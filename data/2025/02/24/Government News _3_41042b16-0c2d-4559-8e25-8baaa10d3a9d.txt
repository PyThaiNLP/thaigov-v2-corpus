February 24, 2025, at 0830hrs, Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub disclosed that Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra delivered a statement on occasion of the 2025 “National Artist Day”.
The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Government, conveyed well-wishes to the national artists, artists in all fields, and all the artistic creators. The Government has declared February 24 of every year, which marked King Rama II’s birthday, as “National Artist Day” because His Majesty was a great literary scholar with talents in various fields of art. It is also a way to honor artists who have been domestically and internationally recognized, and whose artworks benefit the country and society as a whole.
The Government has a policy to build upon Thai wisdoms to promote creative culture by enhancing potential of Thai artists to create artworks that are recognized worldwide. This will also uplift morales and confidence of the artists, and help promote Thai artworks at the international level. National artists are scholars with profound knowledge, and excellent expertise in various fields of art, be it, visual arts, literature, or performing arts. They have dedicated themselves to creating and presenting valuable artworks. They also play an important role in continuing and preserving the nation’s arts and culture for future generations.
The Prime Minister invited Thai people to join in remembering the immense benevolence of King Rama II, who greatly contributed to and nurtured the nation's arts and culture, and to join hands in preserving the nation's precious arts and culture to be forever recognized as the pride of Thailand.
