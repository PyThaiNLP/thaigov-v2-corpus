The Prime Minister ordered Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives to rush in developing rice varieties and distributing them to the farmers, as part of a longer-term solution to low rice prices as a result of planting low-quality and uncertified rice varieties. As for the short-term solution, National Rice Policy Committee would finalize measures to sustain rice prices and later propose to the cabinet for its approval.
The Prime Minister also affirmed to the farmers on the Government’s commitment and priority to solving the problem.
