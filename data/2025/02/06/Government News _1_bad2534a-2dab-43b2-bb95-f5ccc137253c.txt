Air quality in Northeast and South continues to improve
February 5 2025, Deputy Government Spokesperson Sasikarn Watthanachan, on behalf of the Advisor to National Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Command, disclosed that air quality situation in several areas, especially in the Northeast and the South, has gradually improved, whereas air quality index in the North has risen to above the standard level.
At present, the “burning ban” order has been enforced in 50 provinces across the country, resulting in less hotspots. Only 506 hotspots has been reported by Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA), while in the neighboring country like Cambodia, a number of 1,329 hotspots was reported. Most hotspots in Thailand are detected at the sugarcane plantation areas in the West, Central, and Northeast, with top 5 provinces that the hotspots are most detected being Tak, Kanchanaburi, Nakhon Ratchasima, Lopburi, and Phetchabun.
The Royal Thai Police also reported on the results of law enforcement on air pollution-related offenses, according to which 6,107 inspections of black smoke vehicles have been conducted across the country with 266 offenders arrested. Inspection of illegal burning in agricultural areas also resulted in 28 offenders being arrested.
The National Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Command would like to seek cooperation from all sectors to comply with the Government’s anti-PM 2.5 measures by refraining from burning in the agricultural areas and having their vehicles checked to ensure less emission of black smoke. Illegal burnings can be reported 24/7 at the Hotline 1784.
