Air quality continues to improve in most parts of the country
February 25, 2025, Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub, as advisor to National Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Command, disclosed about the latest report of Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA), according to which 237 hotspots have been detected today, less than the same period of last year. Five provinces with the highest number of hotspots are Chaiyaphum, Mukdahan, Sakon Nakhon, Khon Kaen, and Nong Bua Lamphu.
PM2.5 level in Thailand as a whole continues to improve, with many areas recording yellow, green, and blue levels, except for Samut Sakhon, in which the air quality was detected at the orange level. Regionally, the highest number of hotspots is Myanmar, with 894 spots, followed by Thailand, which is mostly in the forest and agricultural areas.
The Meteorological Department of Thailand (TMD) reported that today's dust/haze accumulation in the upper Thailand remains good to moderate and is expected to decrease due to the prevailing winds and rainfall. Despite the improvement of dust/haze situation, National Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Command instructed all provinces to continue enforcing the law, especially on illegal burning.
