PM: Govt vows to eradicate smuggling of e-cigarette
March 18, 2025, at 1140hrs, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra inspected a warehouse in Nonthaburi’s Bang Bua Thong district where more than 260,000 items of e-cigarettes, e-liquids, and related devices, worth 130,000,000 Baht, were found and seized, following the launch of the “Operation Smoke Out”, an integrated operation between Investigation Division of the Metropolitan Police Bureau and Nonthaburi local administrations. Joining the Prime Minister were Minister Attached to the Prime Minister’s Office Jiraporn Sindhuprai, Secretary General to the Prime Minister Prommin Lertsuridej, and concerned agencies. Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub disclosed gist as follows:
The Prime Minister commended and thanked all concerned authorities and officials for their successful operation, and reiterated the need to prosecute and toughen punishments against e-cigarette importers, dealers, and sellers, as well as officials who are derelict in their law enforcement duties. Investigation must be expanded to apprehend accomplices and related networks to eradicate the smuggling of e-cigarettes. The Prime Minister also ordered Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation to provide knowledge and build awareness of students, and school administrators, teachers, and educational personnel alike, on negative effects and illegality of e-cigarettes. If any educational personnel, who are supposed to be role models to children, are found to be using e-cigarettes, they must be subject to both legal and disciplinary action.
According to the Prime Minister, the Government has placed great importance on health promotion of Thai people and children, and commits to implement stricter measures and tighten law enforcement to protect people’s health and create an e-cigarette free society. The operation will never cease if the problem is yet to be solved.
