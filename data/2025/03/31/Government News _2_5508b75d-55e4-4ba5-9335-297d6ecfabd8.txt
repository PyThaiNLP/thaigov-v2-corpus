National cultural heritages and historical sites to be inspected and assessed in the wake of quake disaster
March 30, 2025, at 0915hrs, Deputy Government Spokesperson Sasikarn Watthanachan disclosed that Minister of Culture Sudawan Wangsupakitkosol instructed all agencies under the Ministry’s authority to rush in inspecting and assessing possible damages caused by the earthquake to government buildings, historical sites, and archaeological and cultural properties nationwide, following Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s order for all government agencies to do so with their respective properties and sites.
Provincial cultural offices nationwide have been ordered to thoroughly inspect and assess damage, especially in the areas that are affected by the quake. This is in order to prioritize and develop restoration plans in an efficient and comprehensive manner. Guidelines for assisting individuals in the arts and culture sector, including national artists, folk artists, and entrepreneurs in the cultural industry who have been affected by the disaster, will also be prepared.
Fine Arts Department has been assigned to conduct thorough inspections on historical and archaeological sites, list out affected sites in terms of damage degrees, and develop systematic restoration guidelines. The report will later be proposed to the Government for budget allocation.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, the Government has placed great importance on conservation and protection of national cultural heritages. The restoration will be carried out in a careful and sustainable manner. Information on damage to ancient and archeological sites can be reported to the Fine Arts Department, Ministry of Culture, or the Hotline 1765.
