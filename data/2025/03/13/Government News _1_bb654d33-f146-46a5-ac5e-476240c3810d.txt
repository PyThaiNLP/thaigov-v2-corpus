Q1/2025 GDP expected to grow thanks to surge in foreign tourist arrivals
March 12, 2025, at 0900hrs, Deputy Government Spokesperson Sasikarn Watthanachan disclosed about an increase of incoming tourists during January 1 and March 9, 2025. The recorded number is 7,660,207 tourists, generating approx. 375,035 million Baht. Top 5 tourist arrivals were China (1,121,207), Malaysia (938,173), Russia (558,866), South Korea (419,759), and India (408,543).
In the first week of March 2025, Thailand saw the arrival of 638,863 foreign tourists. It is expected that the number continues to increase in the following weeks thanks to various supporting factors, be it, an increased confidence of tourism operators and enthusiasts following Thailand’s participation in the ITB in Berlin; the Government’s designation of the year 2025 as “Amazing Thailand Grand Tourism and Sports Year”; organization of various tourism and sports activities; an increased confidence in safety; the Government's Ease of Traveling measures that help facilitate traveling to Thailand; and visa exemption for tourists from many countries, such as Malaysia and China; as well as waiving of the immigration form (TM6) for air arrivals; and the Government’s support in increasing flights to Thailand.
As tourism industry is a key driving force to the country's economic growth, a surge in foreign tourist arrivals during the first two months of the year signifies the GDP growth for the first quarter of 2025, which is expected to be over 3.2%, notably higher than the 4th quarter of 2024.
