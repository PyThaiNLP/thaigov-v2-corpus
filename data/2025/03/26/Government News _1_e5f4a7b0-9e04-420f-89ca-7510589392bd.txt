March 26, 2025, Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub disclosed about the official visit of the Prime Minister of Nepal KP Sharma Oli and spouse as guest of the Thai Government during April 1-5, 2025. This will be the first visit of a Nepali Prime Minister to Thailand since an establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1959.
On April 2, 2025, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and members of the cabinet will host an official welcoming ceremony for the Nepali Prime Minister at the Government House, followed by a plenary meeting, the signing ceremony of MoUs, a joint press conference, and a luncheon hosted by the Thai Prime Minister in honor of the Nepali counterpart and spouse.
According to the Government Spokesperson, this official visit of the Nepali Prime Minister will be a good opportunity for both countries to elevate comprehensive relations and cooperation in various areas, especially trade and investment, agriculture, public health, tourism, and service industries. The two leaders will also exchange views on global challenges, i.e., climate change, and discuss cooperation at a multilateral level.
On April 4, 2025, the Prime Minister of Nepal will attend the 6th BIMSTEC Summit to be hosted by Thailand.
