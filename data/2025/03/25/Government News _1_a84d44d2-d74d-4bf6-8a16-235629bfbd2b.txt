PM affirms her Govt has never approved any electricity deal
March 24, 2025, at 2120hrs, at the Parliament, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra attended the special 26th Session of the 26th House of Representatives, the 2nd Year (Second Annual Ordinary Session) to clarify state administration issues raised by the Opposition in a general debate for the purpose of passing a vote of no-confidence in an individual Minister, held in accordance with Section 151 of the Constitution.
The Prime Minister clarified about the energy issue and high electricity cost, and denied an allegation on the Government’s favoritism over the capitalists. She stated that her Government had never given approval to any additional electricity concession nor entered into any electricity deal with a neighboring country. The allegation made by a member of the Opposition is not accurate as electricity deals have been agreed upon and taken effect several years prior to her premiership.
