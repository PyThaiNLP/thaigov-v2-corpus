Thailand reaps to 49th in World Happiness Report for 2025
March 25, 2025, Deputy Government Spokesperson Anukul Prueksanusak disclosed that University of Oxford, in partnership with Gallup, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network and an independent editorial board, has published its World Happiness Report for 2025 where Thailand reaped 9 notches to rank 49th among 147 countries in the report with 6.22 points, the highest improvement in Asia. Finland tops the survey for over 8 years in a roll.
Among ASEAN countries, Thailand ranks 3rd after Singapore (34th) and Vietnam (46th), followed by the Philippines (57th), Malaysia (64th), Indonesia (83rd), Laos (93rd), Cambodia (124th), and Myanmar (126th).
According to the publication, six key variables used in the ranking are GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption, under which Thailand received 1.43 points, 1.55 points, 0.63 points, 0.93 points, 0.22 points, and 0.04 points respectively. Additionally, the fact that Thailand ranks 8th in the world in terms of social support reflects strong relationship and bondage among the Thais who continue to help each other, especially at the family and community level. Although the country’s GDP per capita ranks 81st according to the report, Thai economy continues to improve, resulting in an increased perception of economic security.
The World Happiness Report highlights strengths and weaknesses of each country. In the case of Thailand, moving up to 49th is a positive sign, but there are still factors that need to be worked on in order to sustainably improve quality of life of the Thai people, and to advance Thailand towards becoming a happier country in the future.
