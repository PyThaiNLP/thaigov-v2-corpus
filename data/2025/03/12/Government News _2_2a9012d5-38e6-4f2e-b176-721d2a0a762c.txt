Application of re-entry permit waived for Cambodian, Lao, and Myanmar migrant workers who return home during Songkran
March 12, 2025, Deputy Government Spokesperson Mr. Karom Polpornklang disclosed about the Government’s policy to promote labor relations between Thailand and the neighboring countries, and to alleviate financial burden of migrant workers in returning home and visiting the families during Songkran Festival.
The measure unilaterally allows migrant workers of 3 nationalities (Cambodian, Lao, and Myanmar) who have valid work permits to be able to depart and enter Thailand without having to apply for a re-entry permit nor to pay for the re-entry fee during the waiver period to attend Songkran Festival in their respective home country.
The waiver period is set during April 1 – May 15, 2025. Re-entering Thailand after May 15, 2025 will require application for a re-entry permit.
