March 10, 2025, at 1100hrs, Deputy Government Spokesperson Sasikarn Watthanachan disclosed that the incumbent Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra strives to push forward economic advancements in all dimensions, including tourism promotion.
According to the report of Department of Tourism, Ministry of Tourism and Sports, the 10 provinces with the highest income from tourism in 2024 are: 1. Phuket 497,523.93 million Baht; 2. Chonburi 316,811.02 million Baht; 3. Surat Thani 119,098.39 million Baht; 4. Chiang Mai 103,822.38 million Baht; 5. Krabi 91,042.62 million Baht; 6. Prachuap Khiri Khan 51,702.91 million Baht; 7.

The statistics demonstrates trends and potential of each province in attracting both Thai and foreign tourists. It helps in planning tourism activities, and developing and improving tourist attractions and services in each province in line with the need of tourists, thereby, bolstering local economy and generating more income for local hotels, restaurants, and tourism operators.
High revenues from tourism in the 10 provinces clearly reflect that tourism industry remains a pillar of the Thai economy, especially in the provinces with natural and cultural attractions. The Government has aimed for the year 2025 to be the 'Golden Year of Thai Tourism', where travels can be made all year round, with no low season, and incomes are distributed in both primary and secondary cities, creating economic opportunities for all sectors.
Additionally, in order to elevate Thai tourism standard and boost tourists’ confidence on quality and safety, the Department of Tourism has implemented ‘homestay standards’ program for 226 homestays across the country. The program is expected to draw quality tourists and increase spending per head in a sustainable manner.
