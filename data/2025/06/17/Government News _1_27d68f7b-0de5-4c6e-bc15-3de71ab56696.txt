U.S. Department of State lists Thailand at lowest advisory level for safety and security risks
June 16, 2025, Deputy Government Spokesperson Sasikarn Watthanachan disclosed that the U.S. Department of State has issued its latest travel advisory on June 9, 2025, according to which Thailand has been upgraded to “Level I- Exercise Normal Precautions”, the lowest advisory level for safety and security risks.
The assessment of the U.S. State Department on Thailand as a lowest-risk destination not only reflects the country's positive image, but tourism, hotels and accommodations, restaurants, and related service sectors, will also be directly benefited from such a quality and high-spending market as the U.S. These businesses are hoped to steadily recover, thereby, creating more jobs, generating income, and distributing prosperity to communities across the country.
Although the 3 Southern border provinces, namely, Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat, are listed at “Level II- Exercise Increased Caution”, other major tourist destinations, e.g., Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Pattaya, etc., remain safe according to the international standards.
This accomplishment is another proof of Thailand being a global tourist destination. It reflects the country's efforts in ensuring safety of tourists through various measures, i.e., establishment of Tourist Assistance Centers (TACs), Foreign Tourist Assistance Fund, and the Tourist Courts. The Government would like to thank Thai people of all sectors for joining forces in ensuring security and safety of all the incoming tourists.
