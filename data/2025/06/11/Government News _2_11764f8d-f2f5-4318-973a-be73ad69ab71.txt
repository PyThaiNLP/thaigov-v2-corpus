Cabinet approves budget to MEA and PEA to alleviate public burden on energy cost
June 10, 2025, Deputy Government Spokesperson Sasikarn Watthanachan disclosed that the cabinet has made approval to the proposal of Ministry of Interior to allocate the Government’s FY2025 central fund for emergency and contingency, at the budget framework of 1,418.01 million baht, to Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) to alleviate public burden on electricity cost.
Residential electricity users who belong to the vulnerability groups and consumed no more than 300 units per month will be subsidized for their electricity charges incurred during October 2024 and December 2024. The measure aims to mitigate the impact of constant energy price surge.
