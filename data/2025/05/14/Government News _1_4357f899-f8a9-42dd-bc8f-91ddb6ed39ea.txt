Dr. Nalinee Meets with Senator Tammy Duckworth, Congressional Leaders, and Major U.S. Private Sector Players
Reaffirms Thailand’s Role as a Key Investor, and Explores Joint Manufacturing Opportunities
Washington, D.C. — 13 May 2025 Dr. Nalinee Taveesin, President of Thailand Trade Representatives, met with Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, and key private sector representatives to highlight Thailand’s role as a strategic economic partner and discuss the expansion of Thai private sector investments in the United States.
Dr. Nalinee emphasized that Thai private sector investment in the U.S. exceeds USD 17 billion, creating no fewer than 15,000 jobs across more than 20 states. She underscored Thailand’s strong confidence in the U.S. economy and its firm commitment to being a reliable, long-term partner. She reiterated that Thailand remains one of the U.S.’s closest allies in all dimensions and is committed to contributing to a balanced economic partnership. She also noted the significant presence of Thai Summit’s advanced automotive parts manufacturing facility in Michigan as a strong example of Thai contribution to the U.S. industrial base.
During the meeting, Dr. Nalinee opened the floor for Thai private sector leaders to present their capabilities across industries including manufacturing, technology, energy, and food. All Thai companies expressed their intention to expand investment in the U.S., and noted that their experiences operating in the U.S. have been overwhelmingly positive. Both Senator Duckworth and Senator Slotkin expressed strong support for Thai investment and offered to facilitate and coordinate assistance in any area needed by Thai businesses.
A key topic of discussion was the potential for joint manufacturing between Thailand and the United States. This would involve producing components such as solar panels and automotive parts in Thailand—a long-standing U.S. ally—and shipping them to the U.S. for final assembly. Such a model would not only enhance supply chain resilience but also create added value and employment in both countries.
Dr. Nalinee also welcomed recent remarks by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent at the Saudi–U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh, in which he praised Thailand’s innovative proposals. She agreed with his view that Thailand can serve as a “quick win” for the United States—both in expanding investment opportunities and boosting imports of American products into the Thai market.
On the same day, Dr. Nalinee held discussions with Ms. Pamela Phan of the U.S. Department of Commerce, reiterating Thailand’s readiness to further invest in strategic sectors such as agriculture, energy, and food and beverage.
That evening, Dr. Nalinee presided over the “U.S.-Thailand Collaboration: Networking for Future Business Opportunities” event, organized by the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI). The event served as a key platform to strengthen business links and partnerships between Thailand and the United States. Over 50 representatives from top Thai companies—including Indorama Ventures, Thai Union, Thai Summit, Banpu, and PTT Group—joined the networking session, along with American companies from sectors such as digital technology, cybersecurity, healthcare, biosciences, and consulting.
In her opening remarks, Dr. Nalinee stated that the Thailand–U.S. partnership extends beyond trade and investment figures. “It is about connecting people, ideas, and shared aspirations—these are the foundations of a resilient and sustainable future,” she said. She added that a close and forward-looking partnership is the key to meeting shared challenges and unlocking new opportunities together.
