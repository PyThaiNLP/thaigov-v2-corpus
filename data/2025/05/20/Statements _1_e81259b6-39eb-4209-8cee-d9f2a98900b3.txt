Mr. President,
Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus Director-General of the World Health Organization,
Excellencies,
Distinguished delegates,
It is my honour to address this Assembly at a time when the international community is in dire need to reaffirm its collective commitment to health and sustainable development especially as we approach the last phase to implement the Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs.
Health is the foundation of human dignity and a driver of progress. Strengthening health systems is essential to achieving the SDGs — and not only Goal 3, but also those related to poverty, education, gender equality, and climate action. In Thailand, we are integrating health into all policies to build a resilient society.
And for that, Universal Health Coverage remains central to Thailand’s national agenda. Since 2002, we have expanded access, reduced catastrophic spendings, and are now moving toward a more integrated, digital-first health system to reach under-served populations and improve continuity of care.
We also recognize the power of technology in managing non-communicable diseases or NCDs , applying data-driven tools for early detection and promoting healthier behaviours at scale.
In parallel, we are reinforcing our preparedness for public health emergencies and natural disasters, while integrating mental health into recovery and resilience strategies. We welcome the conclusion of the Pandemic Agreement negotiations, which reflects the strength of multilateralism in building a safer world.
Thailand continues to address the broader determinants of health, including through urban development and inclusive governance. We are proud that Bangkok, Bansuan, Klongchaun, and Sadao have been recognized under the WHO Healthy Cities Network.
Excellencies,
Distinguished delegates,
Lastly, allow me to reaffirm Thailand’s unwavering belief in the World Health Organization. Our enduring partnership is rooted in equity, solidarity, and a shared vision that health is a global public good. We stand by WHO through its essential reforms and remain committed to walking this path together.
I Thank you.
