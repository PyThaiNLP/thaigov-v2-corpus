According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, the Government continues to push for FTA negotiations with new partners, i.e., Sri Lanka, Bhutan, European Free Trade Association (EFTA), etc., to expand markets for the export of Thai products, and to reduce dependence on the US market. The use of FTA privileges not only contributes to significant export growth, but also reduces costs, enhances competitiveness, and increases trade opportunities in the long run, especially in such high-potential market as India, with which Thailand will negotiate for the FTA to cover more products. It is the Government’s commitment to support Thai entrepreneurs’ stable and sustainable advancement in the global markets.
