On this occasion, the two Leaders agreed to elevate the bilateral relations to Strategic Partnership, marking a significant milestone in celebration of the 75th Anniversary of Diplomatic Relations between the two countries, and will assign a joint working team to develop a strategic partnership roadmap.
Both Leaders reviewed the progress of bilateral cooperation which is comprehensive and broad-based, covering security, trade and investment, agriculture and food security, tourism, education, and people-to-people connectivity. They reaffirmed the effectiveness of the existing bilateral mechanisms, such as, among others, the Joint Commission Meeting (JC), Security Dialogue, Forums, Working Groups and High-Level Committee (HLC).
As Strategic Partners, both Leaders emphasised the importance of strengthening and deepening cooperation in the following key areas:

They reaffirmed their shared commitment to ASEAN’s unity, resilience, centrality, and inclusiveness, in promoting peace, stability, cooperation, and development in the region and beyond. In light of the global uncertainties, both sides agreed on the importance of leveraging ASEAN’s collective market size and deepening intra-ASEAN economic integration, enhancing regional economic resilience, and promoting broader partnerships with external partners.
In addition to cooperation under ASEAN, both Leaders also underscored the importance of mutual support and close coordination in other multilateral forums such as BRICS, OECD, APEC, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the United Nations, to address regional and global challenges of shared concern.
