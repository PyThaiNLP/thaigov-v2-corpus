Thai PM Congratulates Singapore’s Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Pledges Stronger ASEAN Cooperation Amid Global Economic Challenges
Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub revealed that on Wednesday, 7 May 2025, at 2:30 PM, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra held a telephone conversation with Mr. Lawrence Wong, Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore, from her office at the Thai Khu Fah Building, Government House. The call was made to congratulate Mr. Wong on his victory in Singapore’s 14th General Election, held on 3 May 2025.
On behalf of the Royal Thai Government, Prime Minister Paetongtarn warmly congratulated Mr. Wong on securing 65.57% of the vote and winning 87 out of 97 parliamentary seats—an increase from the previous election—demonstrating the strong confidence of the Singaporean people in his leadership.
Prime Minister reaffirmed Thailand’s intention to work closely with Singapore’s new government. Both leaders expressed their eagerness to meet again at the upcoming 46th ASEAN Summit in Malaysia later this month.
Prime Minister Wong also extended an invitation for Prime Minister Paetongtarn to make an official visit to Singapore, which she gladly accepted. The visit is expected to take place in the second half of the year, coinciding with the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Thailand and Singapore.
In addition, the two leaders exchanged views on how ASEAN should respond to the broader impact of rising U.S. tariffs, which have affected the global economy. Prime Minister Paetongtarn proposed using the ASEAN Summit as a platform for the ten ASEAN nations to join forces, enhance regional resilience, and promote greater intra-ASEAN collaboration to address these economic challenges.
