PM’s congratulatory call to Singaporean PM
Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub disclosed that on May 7, 2025, at 1430hrs, at Thai Khu Fah Building, Government House, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra made a call to Prime Minister Lawrence Wong of the Republic of Singapore to congratulate him for being re-elected Prime Minister, following the Singapore General Election on Saturday, May 3, 2025.
On behalf of the Thai Government, the Prime Minister congratulated Prime Minister Lawrence Wong who earned 65.57% of votes, an increase from the previous election, and secured 87 out of 97 parliamentary seats, reflecting public confidence on Prime Minister Wong’s leadership.
The Prime Minister took the opportunity to affirm the Thai Government’s commitment in working closely together with the incoming Government of Singapore. Both sides look forward to meeting again at the 46th ASEAN Summit to be held at the end of this month. The Prime Minister also agreed to pay an official visit to Singapore late this year, upon the Singaporean Prime Minister’s invitation, in a bid to reinforce relations and to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Thailand – Singapore diplomatic relations.
The two leaders exchanged opinions on responses against the US tariff policy which has widely impacted ASEAN economies. The Prime Minister was of the view that ASEAN leaders discussed the matter at the upcoming ASEAN Summit, and further strengthen cooperation to cope with global economic challenges.
