Thailand’s UN-EGDI has risen to 52nd in ranking
January 4, 2025, at 1030hrs, Deputy Government Spokesperson Sasikarn Wattanachan disclosed that the Digital Government Development Agency (Public Organization) or DGA reported on the progress related to the country’s digital development, according to which Thailand’s rank on the United Nations (UN)’s E-Government Development Index (EGDI) has risen to 52nd out of 193 countries across the globe, and 2nd in ASEAN.
Throughout the past year, various government agencies have integrated their effort to develop new forms of digital services, focusing on creating central digital platform or digital infrastructure that inclusively accommodate public services, such as “ทางรัฐ” application, a super app which combines more than 153 Government services at one place. Master Data development also promotes interagency collaboration and helps improve efficiency of digital services.
According to UN-EGDI, Thailand’s Human Capital Index (HCI) for 2024 is 0.8032, an increase from 2022’s 0.7879. Human Capital Index (HCI) and Service Provision also fare well with 0.941 (comparing to 0.7338 in 2022), and 0.6988 (comparing to 0.6933 in 2022) respectively.
The Deputy Government Spokesperson added that these accomplishments are parts of Thailand’s goal to be among world’s top 40. This is also in accordance with the country’s 2025-2027 e-government development plan which will be announced soon as a guideline for safety and efficiency enhancement of the government digital services.
