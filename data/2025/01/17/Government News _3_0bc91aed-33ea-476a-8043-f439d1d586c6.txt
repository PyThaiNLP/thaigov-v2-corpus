PM impressed with first field visit to3 Southern border provinces
January 16, 2025, at 1735hrs, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra disclosed, during her return to Bangkok from the field visit to 3 Southern border provinces, that she was very impressed with a warm welcome received from students at Tham Wittaya Foundation School and Narathiwat Rajanagarindra University, as well as public health volunteers in Narathiwat province. The atmosphere was cheerful and lovely. She also commended security authorities for excellent preparation of the field visit, and would revisit the area should an opportunity arise.
The Prime Minister’s field visit was fruitful. On flood management, she followed up on the implementation of related projects to ensure their progress are as planned. The director of Tham Wittaya Foundation School, for instance, requested canal dredging and flood control equipment to alleviate flood and inundation. The budget is approximated at 100 million Baht. Comparing to approx. 400 million Baht in budget that are allocated to the area each year for post-flood restoration and remedies and the fact that local people will no longer need to suffer from severe flooding, it is considered a worthwhile investment. However, details on the matter will have to be looked into.
According to the Prime Minister, she could better visualize problems and solutions, and get to know more about each area from field visits. Not only in the South, but the Prime Minister intends to visit other places if opportunity arises. She also emphasizes the Government’s effort to decentralize power to local governments as they would know best of actual problems and how to solve them.
