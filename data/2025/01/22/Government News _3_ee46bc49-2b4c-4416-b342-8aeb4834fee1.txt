DP World supports Thailand to become region’s transport hub
January 21, 2025, at 0900hrs (Davos local time), at the DP World House, Davos, Swiss Federation, during her attendance at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2025 (WEF AM25), Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra met with H.E. Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chairman and chief executive officer of DP World (UAE).
The Prime Minister was pleased to meet with CEO of the DP World (UAE) to continue the discussion between the latter and former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin last year. She thanked DP World for having confidence in Thailand’s high economic potential, with its strategic location, and affirmed the Thai Government’s policy on the implementation of megaprojects, especially the Landbridge project, and the dual-track railway and the high-speed railway projects, in a bid to promote Thailand as the region’s logistics hub.
DP World CEO expressed the company’s support over the Thai Government’s plan to develop Lat Krabang Inland Container Depot (LICD) into the region’s multi-modal logistics center for cross-border trade between China, Indochina, Malaysia and Singapore through the railway network. Laem Chabang Port’s B Terminal development project to increase capacity for large ships and containers would also accommodate domestic and international transport and logistics. DP World is also ready to conduct a feasibility study on its investment in the Landbridge project to connect the Indian Ocean with the BIMSTEC countries, and support Thailand as ASEAN’s transport hub.
