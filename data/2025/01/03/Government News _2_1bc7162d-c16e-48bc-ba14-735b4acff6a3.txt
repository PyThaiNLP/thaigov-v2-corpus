Motto for 2025 Children’s Day
December 27, 2024, Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub disclosed that Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra announced the motto for 2025 Children’s Day, which falls on Saturday, January 11, 2025, as:
“Every Opportunity is a Learning Experience, Be Ready to Adapt to the Future of Your Own Choice”
According to the Prime Minister, children are usually perceived as mere small humans who cannot do much. However, what the Government sees in them is their value and quality, as what the future holds and whether Thailand would be a good place to live or not depends on these children.
There will be plenty of opportunities to come, and the Prime Minister urged the Thai people, regardless of ages and groups, to grab as many as opportunities they can for learning experiences, as no one is too old to learn. For kids, by learning, they will become resilient and adaptable to what comes their way. She believes that every child has yearned for a bright and happy future. Happiness starts with oneself.
Being resilient to whatever situation, be aware of the path ahead and walk toward the goal with confidence. Thai children are invaluable as they are the country’s future. They hold the key to making Thailand and the world the better place.
