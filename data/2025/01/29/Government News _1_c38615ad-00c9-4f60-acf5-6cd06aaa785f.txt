PM to discuss with Chinese President Xi Jinping on issue of call center gang and hybrid scam
January 28, 2025, at 1230hrs, at the Command Building I, Government House, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra gave an interview on her scheduled visit to People’s Republic of China during February 5-8 that she intended to discuss with President Xi Jinping on the issues of tourism and call center gang and hybrid scam, as well as further development of relations and cooperation to further reinforce brotherly relations between Thailand and China. This year also marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
On the effort to address false rumors widely spread on the social media, Ministry of Digital Economy and Society has sought cooperation with the Chinese counterpart, so there is no need for the Prime Minister to raise this matter up. Discussion between the Thai Prime Minister and President Xi Jinping of China will cover overview of various issues, while the detail will be the Ministry’s responsibility to follow up with Chinese counterparts. She added that her AI-generated video in Chinese to assure the Chinese tourists of Thailand’s safety has been well received by both the Chinese people and agencies.
With regard to the request of Ministry of Tourism and Sports for the Prime Minister to set up a working squad to monitor social media opinions on various issues, the Prime Minister clarified that there was such a team under the responsibility of Ministry of Digital Economy and Society that has been working to protect the country’s image.
