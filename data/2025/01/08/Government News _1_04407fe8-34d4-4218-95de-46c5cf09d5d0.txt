The Prime Minister and APAC Google Cloud president were pleased with close and continued cooperation between Google and the Thai Government following the signing of an MoU between Google and Thai Ministry of Digital Economy and Society in 2023. Today’s meeting would be a good opportunity to take forward closer cooperation, especially on cyber security and anti-online scams, which are considered urgent and prioritized issues for the Prime Minister and the Thai Government.
The president of APAC Google Cloud commends the Government's policy on tackling cyberattacks and online frauds against the public and government agencies, which have become increasingly threatening. Google stands ready to work with the Thai Government in addressing the problems through an establishment of a security unit, tasked to protect the country's critical information infrastructure, monitor and analyze cyber threats, and respond real time to cybersecurity emergencies. Google is also working with Ministry of Digital Economy and Society to prevent online frauds and scams by utilizing technologies to detect and block malicious applications.
The Prime Minister welcomed Google’s collaboration with the Thai Government on cyber security, and assigned Ministry of Digital Economy and Society to discuss the collaboration in detail with Google in a bid to upgrade the country’s cyber security, protect Thai people from being scammed in all cases, and develop policies to enhance Thai agencies’ responses and prevention against complex cyber threats. Thailand and Google will also work proactively in preventing online scams to protect the interests of the Thai people.
