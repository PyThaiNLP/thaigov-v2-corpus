Thailand gains over 156.52 billion Baht in trade value from export promotion activities this year
September 4, 2025, Deputy Government Spokesperson Sasikarn Watthanachan disclosed that Ministry of Commerce’s Department of International Trade Promotion (DITP) has organized over 510 export promotion activities, both domestically and internationally, which have, so far, generated the trade value of 156.52 billion Baht, exceeding the 2025 target of 92.36 billion Baht, and benefiting a total of 226,790 Thai entrepreneurs. It is expected that new activities, planned for later in the year, will generate an additional 10 billion Baht in value.
Notable achievements include the organization of six international trade shows in Thailand, which generated a total value of over 110.3 billion Baht. THAIFEX–ANUGA ASIA 2025, in particular, generated a trade value of 99.1 billion Baht for Thai entrepreneurs and was attended by more than 142,370 people.
An upcoming event to be held in September is the 72nd Bangkok Gems & Jewelry Fair, which will feature over 2,600 booths and is expected to generate at least 3 billion Baht. Realizing the high potential of gems and jewelry industry, DITP will launch a Special Task Force (STF) project with an aim to explore new markets in four regions, namely, Latin America, Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East to increase trade value by 1.6 billion Baht. Other new projects have also been launched to address challenges from U.S. tariff policy, such as, the USA–Thailand Online Business Matching, which generated 190 million Baht, and Thailand–Global Connect, which generated over 518.88 million Baht.
DITP has also a plan to drive soft power, focusing on three main sectors: games, books, and design, as well as other soft power activities in such areas as film, series, wellness, and animation. These efforts have already generated a trade value of more than 12.33 billion Baht, benefiting over 2,410 entrepreneurs.
For FY 2026, DITP has set a target to generate 141.88 billion Baht across 570 projects, aiming to benefit over 294,475 entrepreneurs. This will be achieved through three key strategies: 1) expediting exploration of new markets; 2) enhancing the potential of SMEs to keep up with the digital age; and 3) fully digitizing service systems.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, the Government is committed to promoting exports and soft power to generate more income, create jobs, increase opportunities for Thai entrepreneurs, and, ultimately, uplift people’s quality of life and security. This effort will also affirm Thailand's role as a regional hub for trade and investment.
