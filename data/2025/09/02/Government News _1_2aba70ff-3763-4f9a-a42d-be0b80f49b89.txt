PM instructs local administrations to take care of people along Thai-Cambodian border area according to “Protect the Rear Area” operation plan
June 20, 2025, at 0900hrs, at the Green Room, Thai Khu Fah Building, Government House, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra chaired a meeting to follow up on assistance provision to residents in the provinces along the border areas of Thailand and Cambodia. Participating in the meeting were Deputy Minister of Interior Theerarat Samrejvanich, Prime Minister Secretary General Prommin Lertsuridej, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Interior Ansit Samphantharat, Director-General of the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Passakorn Bunyalak, Director-General of the Department of Provincial Administration Arthit Boonyasophat, with provincial governors of Trat, Sakaeo, Chanthaburi, Burirum, Surin, Sisaket, and Ubon Ratchathani attending via a video conference. Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub disclosed gist of the meeting as follows:
The Prime Minister reiterated that all concerned agencies under the Ministry of Interior are expected to work in an integrative and proactive manner for the people and the nation. She was reported by Surin governor about makeshift bunkers which were only roughly set up, and instructed the province to ensure that those bunkers are strong enough in its structure and that they can effectively protect the people.
With regard to security situation, the Prime Minister instructed relevant agencies, especially the military, to ensure readiness for timely deployment of its personnel and equipment in response to the situation. She reaffirmed the Government’s stance to adhere to peaceful resolution and non-violence. However, should the circumstances go beyond control, safety of frontline military personnel and residents along the border provinces must be prioritized, as the saying goes “Ministry of Interior is a house, and the military is the fence”. Ministry of Interior and related agencies must promptly liaise with provincial governors, district chiefs, and local administrative organizations to take care of the people in accordance with the “Protect the Rear Area” operation plan. The seven border provinces, in particular, must be prepared in all aspects, be it, bunkers, incident action plans, security measures, and preparation of medical facilities and personnel in case of emergency.
In response to all the fake news, the Prime Minister called on all agencies, especially Ministry of Digital Economy and Society, to closely monitor, verify, and clarify the information to prevent confusion and panic. She also expressed confidence on their efficiency and dedication to perform duties for the interest of the Thai people, while the Government stands ready to provide support.
The Prime Minister, then, listened to the reports and updates from all 7 border provinces, regarding the following issues:
1) Maintaining peace and order, and safety according to the context of each province
2) Creating awareness and updating local residents on the situation
3) Surveying bunkers
4) Collaborating with and supporting the army and security agencies
5) Undertaking evacuation and incident response plan drills
Later, at approximately 1130hrs, the Prime Minister took a field trip to Morakot Operations Base in Dom Pradit Subdistrict, Nam Yuen District, Ubon Ratchathani Province, to listen to a briefing on the border situation from the 2nd Army Region and related agencies, and to boost the morale of military personnel of the Suranaree Task Force.
