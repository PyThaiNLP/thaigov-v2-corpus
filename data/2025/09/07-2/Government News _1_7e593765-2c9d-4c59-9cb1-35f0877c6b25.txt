Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul Delivers Inaugural Address Following Royal Command of Appointment
At 11:30 a.m. today, Sunday, 7 September 2025, at the Bhumjaithai Party Headquarters, Mr. Anutin Charnvirakul delivered his inaugural statement following the Royal Command appointing him as the 32nd Prime Minister of Thailand.
In his remarks to the nation, Prime Minister Anutin emphasized his commitment to work tirelessly for the people despite the limited tenure under the current coalition agreement. He appealed for public confidence and assured that the Government would dedicate its efforts to resolving urgent challenges and guiding the country out of crisis.
The Prime Minister outlined four priority areas of action:
1. Economic challenges — To implement immediate measures to reduce the cost of living, including expenses on energy, transportation, and logistics. Debt relief programs for farmers and low-income groups will be introduced, alongside initiatives to generate income for local communities, the foundation of Thai society.
2. National security — To resolve Thai - Cambodian border disputes through peaceful means, and ensuring that Thailand does not cede territory or compromise national interests. Swift and comprehensive compensation will be provided to affected households.
3. Natural disasters — To strengthen systems for early warning, prevention, recovery, and compensation to ensure timely and fair assistance to citizens impacted by natural calamities.
4. Social problems — To intensify efforts to combat drug trafficking, human trafficking, online scams, and illegal gambling. Close cooperation will be pursued with neighboring and partner countries to eliminate these threats to society.
Acknowledging the status of a minority government, Prime Minister Anutin called for cooperation from Members of Parliament to prioritize the people’s interests. He reaffirmed that the Government will act strictly in accordance with the law and will not interfere with judicial processes.
Looking ahead, the Prime Minister underscored the Government’s determination to initiate constitutional reform, paving the way for a new Constitution as guided by the Constitutional Court. Once this process is completed, the House of Representatives will be dissolved to allow for a general election within a four-month timeframe.
The Prime Minister concluded by pledging that the trust placed in him by the Members of Parliament and the Thai people will not be in vain. He vowed to dedicate himself fully to serving the nation and to honouring the coalition agreement.
