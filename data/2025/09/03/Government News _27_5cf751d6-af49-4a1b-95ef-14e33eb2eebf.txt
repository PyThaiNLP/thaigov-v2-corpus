Thailand downgrades diplomatic ties with Cambodia
Thailand downgrades diplomatic ties with Cambodia
July 23, 2025, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, as acting Prime Minister, disclosed that he was already reported by the Royal Thai Army, through Deputy Minister of Defense General Nattaphon Narkphanit, that at approx. 1655hrs, a 14th InfantryRegiment reconnaissance patrol unit were injured by a planted landmine in Huai Bon area, Chong An Ma crossing point, Nam Yuen District, Ubon Ratchathani, with one personnel, identified as Master Sergeant First Class Phichitchai Boonkhorat, losing his right leg. The injured soldiers were evacuated from the area at around 1718hrs.
In light of this, as requested by the 2nd Army Area and the Royal Thai Army, the Government has made an order to close all border checkpoints under the authority of the 2nd Army Area, and strictly prohibit tourists from entering the area. The decision is also made to downgrade diplomatic ties with Cambodia, recall the Thai Ambassador to Cambodia, and expel the Cambodian Ambassador to Thailand back to his country. Further action regarding diplomatic relations will later be decided.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs was also ordered to hand over a protest letter to Cambodia, as it has been proven that no such landmines exist during previous patrols, and these are newly-planted mines that injured Thai military personnel twice. It is, therefore, appropriate to escalate Thailand’s response in this manner.
