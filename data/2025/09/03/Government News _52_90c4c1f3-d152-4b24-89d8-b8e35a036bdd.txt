​Govt. bans drone flights nationwide
August 4, 2025, Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub, as member of Ad Hoc Center for Thailand-Cambodia Border Situation, warned that the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) has issued a temporary nationwide ban on all drone operations from July 30 to August 15, 2025, or until further notice, to prevent risks against national security and safety. Violators will be subject to penalties under the Air Navigation Act B.E. 2497 and related amendments, which may include imprisonment for up to one year, or a fine not exceeding 40,000 Baht, or both. CAAT also requested that private sector who need to use drones for specific purposes, such as for agricultural purposes, notify relevant agencies for security and safety’s sake.
The Government Spokesperson also clarified about a suspicious drone saw flying in Surin province on August 4, 2025. According to Army Spokesperson Major General Winthai Suvaree, that drone belongs to the Thai military for official use in surveillance and system testing. It is not related to any foreign threat. The drone was forced to make an emergency landing due to unfavorable weather conditions. Nevertheless, the Government has instructed security agencies to thoroughly investigate several cases of drone sightings in other areas.
The Government and all levels of security agencies place utmost priority on public safety and national sovereignty, and would like to call on everyone to help monitor and report to the nearest authorities, i.e., police station, and military unit, or call security hotline at 1374, should they spot suspicious drone operation or activities that seem to violate the drone flight ban in a bid to prevent ill-intentioned individuals from using technology to violate laws or hinder national security
