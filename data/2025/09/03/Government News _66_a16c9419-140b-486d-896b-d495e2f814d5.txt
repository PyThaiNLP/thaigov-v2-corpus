Bangkok secures top spot as Best Cities for Gen Z
August 20, 2025, at 0830hrs, Deputy Government Spokesperson Sasikarn Watthanachan disclosed about the survey of Timeout, a global magazine on hotels, tourism, and entertainment, on the Best Cities for Gen Z. Timeout gathered the opinion of 18,500 respondents who are under 30, and Bangkok topped the survey as Best City for Gen Z.
According to the survey, about 84% of Gen Z respondents reported being happy with their life in Bangkok which they cited a budget-friendly place to live. The Thai capital also topped the charts as the easiest city for young people to make new friends, reinforcing its reputation as a deeply social, welcoming place to live. Bangkok secures top spots both globally and in Asia, beating out such major Asian cities as Shanghai (10th), Beijing (12th), and Tokyo (14th). Aside from Bangkok, Chiang Mai also ranks 18th in the survey.
This recognition reflects not only Bangkok’s global appeal, but also the strength of Thai culture in creating an environment where young people can thrive. The city dominated in the categories that matter most to Gen Z who seek dynamic experiences, genuine community, work-life balance, and, crucially, the financial freedom to enjoy it all.
This achievement is not only an honor for Bangkok but also a reflection of Thailand's overall potential. The Government would like to thank the Thai people and all sectors for contributing to the nation’s development, and would continue to improve the quality of life of its people and make Thailand a favorite destination for the new generations in a sustainable manner.
