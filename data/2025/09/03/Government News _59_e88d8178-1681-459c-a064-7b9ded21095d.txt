​Govt calls on global community to pressure Cambodia on landmine clearance
August 13, 2025, Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub, as member of Ad Hoc Center for Thailand-Cambodia Border Situation, disclosed about the Government’s profound concern over the Thai soldiers injured by Cambodia’s planted anti-personnel landmines on the Thai territory while on a patrol mission. This is clearly a violation of Thai sovereignty, a breach of the Ottawa Treaty, and an inhumane act.
Deputy Minister of Defense and chair of the Ad Hoc Center for Thailand-Cambodia Border Situation Gen. Nattaphon Narkphanit affirmed the Government’s commitment to provide all the injured military personnel with full treatment and deserved compensation, and emphasized that security authorities would not stay complacent on the situation and would continue to protect Thailand's sovereignty and national security.
The Thai Government urged the international community to pressure the Cambodian Government on landmine clearance. States party to the Ottawa Treaty are also called on to review their assistance that has not yielded concrete results, and consider other necessary measures to prevent additional casualties from this inhumane act.
