Govt to push 4 urgent measures under "Thai-made, Thai-used, Thais helping Thais" scheme
July 31, 2025, Deputy Government Spokesperson Sasikarn Watthanachan disclosed that following the situation along the border area of Thailand-Cambodia, the Government, through Ministry of Commerce, has made an order to provincial commerce offices in 7 border provinces to prevent profiteering and shortage of goods, especially basic necessities, under the "Thai-made, Thai-used, Thais helping Thais" scheme.
The scheme consists of 4 urgent measures:
1. Controlling prices of goods and increasing sales points
2. Connecting markets and expanding trade opportunities internationally for more distribution channels
3. Maintaining market share in Cambodia and seeking new alternative markets in the ASEAN region
4. Providing financial support to affected businesses in the area through soft loans and debt moratorium, especially by SME D Bank and EXIM Bank
Additionally, trade activities and events, as well as “Thai Fruits Festival”, will be organized in the border area of 7 provinces to promote sales of goods. With border checkpoints remaining closed, Thailand Post will take part in facilitating the distribution of goods and fruits to the destinations and providing delivery options to the entrepreneurs.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, the Government’s implementation of the "Thai-made, Thai-used, Thais helping Thais" scheme is aimed at bolstering domestic economy in all dimensions, and ensuring that the Thai people get through the current situation in a steady manner.
