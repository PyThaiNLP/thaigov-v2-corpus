Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lead diplomatic corps to observe demining operation and inspect civilian damages
August 14, 2025, Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub, as member of Ad Hoc Center for Thailand-Cambodia Border Situation, disclosed about the Thai Government’s call for the global community to pressure Cambodia to stop planting anti-personnel landmines which is considered a serious violation of international law and fundamental humanitarian principle, a breach of the Ottawa Treaty, and an inhumane act.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs will lead a group of diplomatic corps, especially those from states parties to the Ottawa Convention, to visit Ubon Ratchathani and Sisaket provinces on August 16, 2025 (Saturday). There, the delegation will receive a briefing and observe demining operations of the Humanitarian Mine Action Unit 2 at Sisaket’s Phu Makua area before traveling to Ban Nong Mek, Sao Thong Chai sub-district, Kantharalak district and Phum SaRon Wittaya School to inspect civilian damages. The Thai military also plans to take the Interim Observer Team (IOT) on a field visit to the affected area on August 18-20, 2025.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Thai Government strictly upholds international law and humanitarian principles, and commits to fairly resolving the situation by peaceful means. It strives to take every possible action to fully protect the country's sovereignty and safety of the Thai people, and is always ready to prove to the global community what has really happened.
