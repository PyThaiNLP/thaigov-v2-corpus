Public urged to report social media channels that aims at defaming Thailand and its people
July 21, 2025, at 0900hrs, Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub disclosed that he was reported on a YouTube channel, named “Carl Reed - Your Thailand Guide”, allegedly attempting to defame Thailand and Thai tourism. The YouTube channel appears to aim at presenting distorted information of Thailand, slandering Thai tourism, and discriminating Thai people, as well as the Indians. Its content subtly incites hatred and tension between people in Southeast Asia and Asia as a whole.
Owner of the YouTube channel claims to be a westerner with a western name and appearance. However, after a thorough investigation, it reveals to be a Cambodian national using AI technology to modify his voice to sound like a Westerner.
The Government Spokesperson, therefore, urged the public to join forces in reporting the channel for further inspection and suspension by YouTube. To report the YouTube channel, navigate to the channel's page (Carl Reed - Your Thailand Guide), click the "About" tab, select "Report user," and choose the reason “Misleading or impersonation”. More details about the reason for the report can be added as “This channel is operated by a Cambodian individual who uses AI to impersonate a Westerner in order to criticize Thailand and make negative accusations against people in Asia.”.
The Government Spokesperson added that if more social media channels of the similar nature are found, the public is encouraged to notify the authorities immediately to prevent spread of fake news about Thailand.
