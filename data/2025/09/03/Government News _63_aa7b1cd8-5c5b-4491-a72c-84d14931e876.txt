Govt Spokesperson: Thai economy is reviving
August 18, 2025, Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub disclosed about the Office of National Economic and Social Development Council’s economic report for the 2nd quarter of 2025 (April – June 2025), according to which the Thai economy expanded by 2.8% (YoY), and 3.0% for the first half of 2025.
The Thai economy in 2025 is projected to expand within the range of 1.8 – 2.3%, with the midpoint forecast of 2.0%, an upward revision from 1.3–2.3% (midpoint forecast of 1.8%) in the previous projection, as recovery of global economy and strong expansion of goods export in the latter half of the year are forecasted, benefiting the Thai economy as a whole.
On economic stability, the unemployment rate stood at 0.91%, slightly higher than 0.89% in the previous quarter but lower than 1.07% in the same quarter of the previous year. The headline inflation was at -0.3%, the first negative figure in five quarters, while core inflation was at 1.0%. The current account recorded a surplus of 0.6 billion US dollars (17.1 billion Baht). At the end of June 2025, international reserves stood at 262.4 billion US dollars, and public debt amounted to 12.07 trillion Baht, accounting for 64.2 percent of GDP.
Several factors are expected to support economic activity in the latter half of the year. These include an increase in public investment expenditure, sustained growth in domestic consumption, and an improvement in private investment, particularly in automobile, industrial machinery, and office equipment.
For tourism sector, the number of inbound tourists during the first 7 months (January – July 2025) is at 19.3 million people, a decrease of 6.4% from the same period of the previous year, due to the decrease in short-haul tourists. With this, the total number of inbound tourists is expected at 33 million people. However, international tourism receipt is projected to reach 1.57 trillion Baht, an increase of 4.7%, as a result of the rise in per-head spending driven by the growing proportion of long-haul tourists, which will compensate for the decline in revenue from short-haul tourists.
According to the Government Spokesperson, various tools and measures for economic stimulus, relief, and recovery have been prepared and implemented by the Government, including accelerating the disbursement of public and private investment, and adjusting policy interest rates. These measures not only aim at helping mitigate the impact of the "Trump tariff", but also being a key driving force to create economic momentum for the remaining quarters of this year.
