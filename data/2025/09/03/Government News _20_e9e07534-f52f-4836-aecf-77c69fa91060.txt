New form of online scams warned
New form of online scams warned
July 18, 2025, Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub disclosed that the Government has been notified about a new form of online scams by call center gangs. What the scammers did was opening social media pages falsely claiming they were foundations or legal offices that assist the public for free.
An example is a Facebook page named "Online-Scammed Victim Assistance Office" which targets individuals who have already been conned by call center gangs into transferring money, or those who have purchased goods online but never received them or received items that did not match descriptions.
These scam pages will claim themselves to be non-profit organizations established to assist online-scammed victims. Those who reach out to them will be instructed to add LINE of a “lawyer”. Their personal information will, then, be forwarded to a fake policeman who would present a fake police id to gain their trust. These are teamwork of scammers who intend to revictimize the scammed victims, and are now under investigation by the police.
The Government Spokesperson warned the public not to fall for various forms of scams, and never transfer money to individuals or pages that are not trustworthy, especially those that impersonate legitimate organizations on social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. He added that any suspicious act of scam can be immediately reported to the Government Contact Center: Hotline 1111, or e-mail: [email protected].
