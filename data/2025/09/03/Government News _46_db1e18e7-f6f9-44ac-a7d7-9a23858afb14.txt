​Neither Thailand nor Cambodia take full control of Prasat Ta Kwai temple
July 31, 2025, at 1155hrs, Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub, as member of Ad Hoc Center for Thailand-Cambodia Border Situation, disclosed about the Royal Thai Army’s clarification on the rumor that Thailand has lost control of Prasat Ta Kwai temple to Cambodia, saying that it is not true.
Based on the clarification, with the ceasefire agreement taking effect, neither side has yet to take full control of the temple, and the 2nd Army Area is not able to seize Prasat Ta Kwai temple’s “350 Hill”. Currently, soldiers of both Thailand and Cambodia have guarded different parts of Prasat Ta Kwai, facing each other at approx. 50 meters away from the ancient temple. Thailand, through its commitment to strictly adhere to the ceasefire agreement and the international law, commits not to conduct military operation in the cultural heritage area.
Deputy Minister of Defense General Nattaphon Narkphanit, as chair of the Ad Hoc Center for Thailand-Cambodia Border Situation, gave a media interview prior to the meeting this morning to urge the public to exercise their judgment against rumors and distorted information spread on the social media, as those who posted simply wanted to incite conflict and misunderstanding. It is best for the public to follow information and updates from official sources, i.e., the Royal Thai Armed Forces or relevant government agencies.
