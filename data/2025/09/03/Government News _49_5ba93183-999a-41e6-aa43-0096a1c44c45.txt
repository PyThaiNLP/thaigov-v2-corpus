Public called on to report fake news at Hotline 1111
Public called on to report fake news at Hotline 1111
August 3, 2025, Deputy Government Sasikarn Watthanachan denounced news and images spread online about the brutality of Thai military against Cambodian soldiers, especially them beheading Cambodian soldiers and trampling the corpses, saying they are absolutely fake news aiming to incite conflict and hatred among people of the two countries.
The Thai Government would like to reaffirm that all the military operations were strictly deployed based on the humanitarian principle, international law, and military regulations. Injured Cambodian soldiers have received appropriate medical care before being sent back to the Cambodian side at Chong Jom border crossing point in Surin province. The return procedure was carried out in a transparent, open, and respectful manner.
Ministry of Digital Economy and Society revealed top 10 fake news shared on the internet during the past week, all of which are related to the Thailand- Cambodia situation:
News about Thai soldiers beheading Cambodian soldiers
News about 140 Thai soldiers being killed
News about 40 Thai soldiers killed and 30 captured
News that Norway donated F-16 fighter jets to Thailand
News that the Governor of Surin declared the province as war disaster zone
News that Thai soldiers recaptured Preah Vihear Temple
News that Thailand used biological weapons to attack Cambodia
News about Thailand’s air operation to release toxic substances on Cambodian civilians
News about the 2nd Army Area raising funds to help the front lines
News about the Permanent Secretary to Ministry of Defense ordering suspension of medical service provision to Cambodian patients
All the news and related images above have been disproved. They simply used old or unrelated photos with false captions to incite widespread misunderstanding which could potentially hinder national security. The Government would, therefore, like to seek public cooperation to stop the vicious cycle of fake news by not sharing such information if they are not certain whether it is true or not. They are urged to check with official sources, and if suspicious information or those believed to be fake news are found, the public is called on to report to Hotline 111, or Line ID: @antifakenewscenter, or www.antifakenewscenter.com
