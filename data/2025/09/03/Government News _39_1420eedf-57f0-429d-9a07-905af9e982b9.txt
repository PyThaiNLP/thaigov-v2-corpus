The Royal Thai Government Confirms a 24-Hour Situation Monitoring through the Ad Hoc Centre for the Thailand-Cambodia Border Situation War Room
On 29 July 2025, at 6.30 p.m., Mr. Jirayu Houngsub, Government Spokesperson and member of the Ad Hoc Centre for the Thailand-Cambodia Border Situation, stated that the government had directed the Ad Hoc Centre for the Thailand-Cambodia Border Situation’s war room, under the leadership of General Nattaphon Narkphanit,
Deputy Minister of Defense, to operate as a central command hub.  The war room will receive and assess real-time updates from all sectors 24 hours a day.
Following the ceasefire negotiation in Putrajaya, Malaysia, the war room held continuous meetings and kept monitoring updates around the clock, especially those from the 1st and 2nd Army Areas, as well as the Royal Thai Navy, which is responsible for Chanthaburi and Trat provinces.
The war room also monitors information and developments along the seven border provinces. In case of critical incidents or urgent missions, the center coordinates directly with relevant government agencies and communicates through the Government House and Public Relations Department’s official channels.
Mr. Jirayu adds that today, at 10.30 a.m., the Commander of the 1st Army Area met informally with Cambodia’s 5th Regional Military Commander at the Ban Khlong Luek permanent border checkpoint in Sa Kaeo Province. Similarly, the Commander of the 2nd Army Area met with Cambodia’s 4th Regional Commander at 10.00 a.m. at Chong Chom checkpoint, Surin Province.
Key outcomes from the initial discussion include:
1.    Immediate ceasefire in the conflict zone.
2.    Absolute prohibition of firing on civilians.
3.    Suspension of all military reinforcements.
4.    Prohibition of troop movements toward the border.
5.    Safe and facilitated repatriation of the wounded and deceased to their respective countries.
In addition, both sides agree to establish a joint coordination team, with 4 representatives from each side, and to hold further discussions during the upcoming GBC meeting on 4 August 2025.
In the eastern zone, the Commander of the Chanthaburi-Trat Border Defense Command held an online meeting at 9.00 a.m. with Cambodia’s 3rd Regional Military Commander, followed by an in-person meeting at 1.00 p.m. at the Ban Phak Kad permanent checkpoint in Chanthaburi Province.
Agreed conclusions from the eastern border meeting:
1.    Both sides confirm the ceasefire starting from midnight, in line with the Thai-Cambodian government agreement.
2.    No movement of troops or weapons from current locations.
3.    After the GBC meeting, an additional RBC meeting takes place in Pailin Province.
4.    Both sides agree to restore and strengthen bilateral relations.
The government assigns the Ad Hoc Centre for the Thailand-Cambodia Border Situation to reconvene tomorrow (Wednesday, 30 July 2025) at 9.30 a.m., chaired by the Secretary-General of the National Security Council, to monitor these key issues:
1.    Any ceasefire violations by Cambodia and Thailand’s response measures.
