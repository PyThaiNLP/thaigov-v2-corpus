Govt continues to combat narcotics smuggling even amid Thailand-Cambodia border situation
August 6, 2025, at 0830hrs, Deputy Government Spokesperson Anukul Prueksanusak disclosed that some drug dealers took the opportunity of Thailand being engaged in the border situation with Cambodia to smuggle narcotics through natural borders into Thailand.
On August 2, 2025, while on patrol along Phra That Doi Ang Khang route and Ban Luang intersection in Mae Ngon sub-district, Fang district, Chiang Mai province, troops from the 3rd Cavalry Company, under the Chaiyanupap Task Force, intercepted a group of narcotics smugglers and managed to secure the area. Upon inspection, they found 9 backpacks, each containing approx. 150,000 methamphetamine pills. A total of 1,350,000 pills were seized and handed over to Fang Police Station for further prosecution.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, the Government's policy to intensify narcotics suppression operation has resulted in significant interceptions. From October 1, 2024 up to now, troops from the 3rd Cavalry Company, under the Chaiyanupap Task Force, have made 360 interceptions and arrested 381 suspects. Confiscated narcotics include: 153,702,011 pills of methamphetamine; 145.8 kg of heroin; 8,192 kg of crystal meth; 93.5 kg of opium; and 696 kg of ketamine. If these confiscated narcotics were successfully delivered, the estimated economic damage from their value would have reached 32,093,428,650 Baht.
The Government has instructed all relevant border authorities to strictly monitor and combat drugs smuggling even amid the Thai-Cambodian border situation to ensure national security and public safety. The public is also called on to take part in this endeavor by reporting to the authorities on any suspicious act of drug smuggling at the following channels: notifying via Hotline 1386 (24/7) or ONCB website: https://1386.oncb.go.th, submitting a written complaint to Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) central or regional offices, or reporting in person at the ONCB's central or regional offices.
