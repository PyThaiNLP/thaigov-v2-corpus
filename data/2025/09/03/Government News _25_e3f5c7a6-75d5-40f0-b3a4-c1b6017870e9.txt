Cabinet approves 2nd action plan to solve problem of particulate matter pollution (2025-2027)
July 22, 2025, Deputy Government Spokesperson Sasikarn Watthanachan disclosed that the cabinet has made approval to the 2nd action plan to drive the national agenda on ‘solving the problem of particulate matter pollution’ for 2025-2027 and the next five years, as proposed by Ministry of National Resources and Environment.
The cabinet, in its meeting dated October 1, 2019, has originally approved the 1st action plan to drive the national agenda on ‘solving the problem of particulate matter pollution’ (2019-2024), and assigned relevant agencies to prepare detailed activities for the implementation of the action plan, i.e., enhancing area-based management efficiency, preventing and reducing pollution at the sources, and increasing pollution management efficiency.
Upon completion of the 1st action plan, after-action review and lesson-learned visualizing have been carried out through public hearing in 4 areas: the lower Northern region, the upper Northern region, the Northeastern region, and the Central region, and the results have been used in the development of the 2nd action plan.
The 2nd action plan to drive the national agenda on ‘solving the problem of particulate matter pollution’ for 2025-2027 primarily aims at addressing transnational pollution, and leveraging various mechanisms, i.e., technologies, laws, regulations, economic measures, and other necessary measures, to prevent and reduce pollution at the sources which cover urban areas, forests, and agricultural areas.
