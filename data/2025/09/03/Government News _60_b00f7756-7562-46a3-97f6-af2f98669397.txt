Among the 502 foreign businesses granted, 123 applied for new foreign business license, whereas the other 379 applied for a business certificate (either through BOI, Industrial Estates Authority of Thailand, or other privileges under international treaties or agreements). The number of permitted foreign businesses during the period increased by 117 businesses (30%) compared to the first half of 2024.

The Government appreciated foreign investors’ confidence on Thailand’s potential, despite the ongoing situations involving U.S. reciprocal duty policy and its impact on Thailand's trading partners, as well as the Thailand-Cambodia situation. It commits to continue promoting ease of doing business and investment privileges to maintain their trust and confidence.
