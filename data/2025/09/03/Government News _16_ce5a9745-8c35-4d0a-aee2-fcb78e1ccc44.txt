Govt vows to work closely with global community to eradicate call center gangs
July 10, 2025, Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub disclosed that the Government has been reported on continued efforts of the Royal Thai Police, through the Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau, to suppress, raid, and arrest call center gangs and the culprits behind them. The most recent case is the police’s raid of 19 locations in 3 provinces (Bangkok, Samut Prakan and Chonburi). These places are owned by “Mr. Kok An”, a Cambodian national and owner of the Crown Casino Resorts, a 25-storey building, an 18-storey building, and the Hiso building which are allegedly large-scale call center gang bases in Poipet, Cambodia, adjacent to Aranyaprathet District, Sa Kaeo Province. An arrest warrant was also issued against Mr. Kok An, accusing him of his involvement in transnational crimes and money laundering.
The operation of the Royal Thai Police was conducted under the Prime Minister’s order, made three months ago, to beef up suppression of transnational crimes and arrest the culprits and masterminds behind call center gangs that have scammed both the Thais and people across the world. The Government hopes to arrest more of them within this month. The Government Spokesperson added that the measures to cut off internet, water, and electricity remain intact in a bid to disrupt their illegal operations. With the UNODC's map and the Amnesty International’s report that allege Cambodia as a global hub for scamming operations, Thailand commits to working closely together with the international community to address this problem in a concrete manner.
