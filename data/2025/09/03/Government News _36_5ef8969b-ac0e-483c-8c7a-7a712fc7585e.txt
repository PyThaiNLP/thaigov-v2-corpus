Thai Government Confirms ASEAN Chair H.E. Anwar Ibrahim Invites Thai Leader to Discuss Thailand-Cambodia Conflict
Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham to Lead Thai Delegation; No Negotiation on Maps. Thailand Reaffirms Sovereignty Over Every Inch of Its Territory
Mr. Jirayu Houngsub, Government Spokesperson and Member of the Ad Hoc Centre for the Thailand-Cambodia Border Situation, revealed that the Thai Government has received an official invitation from Mr. Anwar Ibrahim, Prime Minister of Malaysia and current ASEAN Chair, to participate in a consultation on regional peace efforts. The meeting is scheduled for tomorrow (Monday, 28 July 2025) at the Prime Minister’s Office in Kuala Lumpur. The Thai delegation will depart from the Royal Thai Air Force Base at approximately 10:30 a.m., and the meeting is set for 3:00 p.m. Malaysian time.
The Thai delegation will be led by Mr. Phumtham Wechayachai, Acting Prime Minister, and include Mr. Maris Sangiampongsa, Minister of Foreign Affairs; General Nattaphon Narkphanit, Deputy Minister of Defense; Dr. Prommin Lertsuridej, Secretary-General to the Prime Minister; and Mr. Jirayu himself, as a committee member of the Ad Hoc Centre.
It has been confirmed that the ASEAN Chair has also invited representatives of the Cambodian government. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet is expected to attend in person.
Mr. Jirayu went on to clarify that recent reports in certain Thai media outlets, citing anonymous sources, claiming that Thailand would agree to use Cambodia’s 1:200,000-scale map in a ceasefire negotiation, are completely false and entirely unfounded. The Thai Government has consistently adhered to the 1:50,000-scale map.
“No government or individual would ever sell out their own country. At a time when the nation faces threats, spreading such misinformation must be approached with extreme caution,” Mr. Jirayu emphasized.
He added that the upcoming consultation is intended to listen to all proposals that could contribute to restoring peace. The Thai Government remains committed to defending the nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Every square inch of it.
