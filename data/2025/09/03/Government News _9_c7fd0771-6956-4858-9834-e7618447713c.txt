PM reaffirms commitment to protect the country’s sovereignty
July 1, 2025, at 1400hrs, at Santi Maitri Building, Government House, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra disclosed about the ruling of the Constitutional Court to accept a petition submitted against her, and its majority vote to suspend the Prime Minister from official duties from July 1, 2025 onward until the Court makes a decision on the issue.
With her full respect to the Court’s ruling, the Prime Minister stated that she would discontinue her official duties as the prime minister. However, she would not stop, even for a minute, to act for the country as a Thai.
In preparation for filing a written clarification within 15 days, as ordered by the Constitutional Court, the Prime Minister would provide full explanation regarding the leaked audio clip, especially her genuine and more-than-100% intention to serve the country, protect Thailand’s sovereignty, safeguard the lives of the Thai soldiers, and ensure peacefulness.
Although some may not be pleased with the way she did, the Prime Minister would make an effort to prove her sincerity and well intention for the country’s interest, not her own. The Prime Minister reiterated that if one read between the lines, one would understand her true intention. She also expressed appreciation toward all the encouragement and apologized to the Thai people once again for what has happened that made them feel concerned.
