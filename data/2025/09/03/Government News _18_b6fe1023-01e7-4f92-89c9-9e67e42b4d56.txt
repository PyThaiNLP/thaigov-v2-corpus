Herb of the year…
July 13, 2025, Deputy Government Spokesperson Anukul Prueksanusak disclosed about the Government’s policy to promote Thai herbs and local wisdoms through the implementation of the campaign “Herb of the Year”. The campaign is aimed at uplifting traditional and herbal medicines as an alternative for quality, safe, and accessible healthcare services, and promoting Thai herbs as the nation’s soft power for long-term revenue generation and economic advancement.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, 5 popular herbs, namely, turmeric, phlai (Cassumunar ginger), black ginger, kratom (Mitragyna speciose), and cannabis, have been named “Herb of the Year”, as they could generate over 3.526 billion Baht in revenue in the past year.
The Government, through Ministry of Public Health, has recently organized “Thailand Herbal Expo 2025” which was very well received with over 300,000 participants, an increase of 20% from the last-year event. It is estimated that cash, worth over 198 million Baht, was circulated at the event from sales of herbs. This reflects remarkable growth and development of Thai herbs.
The Deputy Government Spokesperson emphasized that the Government has placed importance on the development of Thai traditional medicine, alternative medicine and herbs, and strives to promoting Thai traditional medicine, alternative medicine, and local wisdoms as soft powers for wellness tourism. It is also ready to provide financial support for herbal business entrepreneurs and farmers as part of the endeavor to boost confidence of both Thai and foreign tourists on the country’s health service plans, and generate incomes in a sustainable manner.
