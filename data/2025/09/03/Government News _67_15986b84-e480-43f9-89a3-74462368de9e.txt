​Thailand to host FIVB Volleyball Women’s World Championship 2025 during Aug 22 – Sep 7, 2025
August 22, 2025, Deputy Government Spokesperson Sasikarn Watthanachan extended an invitation for all the Thai people to welcome athletes and tourists from all over the world, as Thailand will be hosting the FIVB Volleyball Women’s World Championship 2025 during August 22 – September 7, 2025.
This competition is expected to draw many more tourists to Nakhon Ratchasima and Phuket, the main venues, especially those from South Korea, Japan, and Malaysia. Although South Korea women's national volleyball team does not make it to the tournament, volleyball remains very popular among the South Koreans.
Thailand’s hosting of the FIVB Volleyball Women’s World Championship 2025 will showcase the country's image as world class sports destination, in line with the Government’s campaign on “Amazing Thailand Grand Tourism and Sports Year 2025”. This will also be an opportunity to boost its reputation in hosting other international sports tournaments, e.g., MotoGP, and 2025 SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games, and to promote continuous growth of tourism economy. The Thai Government would, therefore, like to encourage all the Thai people to be a good host and to cheer on the Thai athletes competing in this tournament in order to demonstrate the power of Thailand's warm and friendly spirit, and its readiness to become international sports hub for the region and the world.
