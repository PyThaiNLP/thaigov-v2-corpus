Bangkok named world’s best digital nomad destination for 2025
July 18, 2025, Deputy Government Spokesperson Sasikarn Watthanachan disclosed about the survey of www.HotelWithTub.com on top 100 digital nomad destinations in 2025, according to which Bangkok tops the list with a total score of 91/100, and Nakhon Ratchasima ranks 5th with the final score of 80/100.
To identify the world’s top 100 destinations for digital nomads in 2025, the website analyzed data from 1,370 locations worldwide. Each destination was evaluated based on seven key factors: Nomad Score, Quality of Life Score, Safety Score, Return Rate (%), Cost of Living for a Solo Nomad, Cost of Living for a Family, and Instagram Hashtag Volume.
According to HotelWithTub, life in Bangkok is not just affordable, it’s genuinely enjoyable. The city’s infrastructure is also reliable, the public transport system is efficient, and coworking spaces—from sleek downtown towers to garden cafés—are plentiful. Coupling with its cultural appeal and digital presence, Bangkok has become the gold standard for modern location-independent living.
The Government would like to thank the Thai people of all sectors for taking part in driving forward the country to the recognition of the global community. It strives to further promote infrastructure development, technology and quality of life in a bid for Thailand to become a global hub of opportunities, both in terms of work, investment, and enjoyable living.
