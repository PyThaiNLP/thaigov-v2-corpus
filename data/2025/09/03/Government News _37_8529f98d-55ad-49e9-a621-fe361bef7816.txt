Incident Report on the Thai-Cambodian Border Clash
27 July 2025
According to the report from the 2nd Army Area Operations Center, the following summarizes key developments along the Thai-Cambodian border. A total of seven key areas of engagement were reported, representing a decrease of three areas from the first day of the conflict.
- Chong Bok Area: Both sides maintain troop presence. Report indicates reinforcement of Cambodian forces toward the Phu Makua Hill and Chong Ahn Ma areas. Thai forces maintain control along the 1:50,000 operational line, while Cambodian troops have repositioned further south.
- Phu Phee-Don Tual Temple and Chong Ta Thao Areas: Continued troop presence on both sides. Cambodian forces are believed to have sustained significant losses, including unconfirmed reports of the death of the Cambodian Division Commander responsible for this area.
- Frontline of Preah Vihear: Ongoing engagements persist. Cambodian forces have primarily relied on sniper fire from within the Preah Vihear temple complex, targeting Thai personnel. Thai forces continue to hold Phu Makua Hill firmly along the designated 1:50,000 operational line.
- Chong Chom Area: Cambodian forces employed indirect fire to target Thai civilian homes and reportedly attempted to advance tanks toward Chong Krang, approximately two kilometers west of Ta Kwai Temple.
- Ta Muen Thom Temple Area: Cambodian forces advanced from the east throughout the day, prompting a tactical withdrawal by Thai forces, who responded with artillery fire, resulting in the withdrawal of Cambodian troops.
- On the morning of 27 July 2025 at approximately 06.30 hours, four unidentified rockets were launched from Cambodia’s Krung Samrong Airport, striking Thai civilian homes—damaging two houses and killing five domestic animals.
Thai forces successfully secured the Chong Ahn Ma area in Nam Yuen District, Ubon Ratchathani Province, along the 1:50,000 operational line. Cambodian forces are still attempting to infiltrate several key points including Chong Ta Thao, Preah Vihear, Phu Makua Hill, Chong Chom, Ta Khwai Temple, and Ta Muen Temple.
Cambodian attacks remain irregular and may constitute violations of rules of engagement, posing further risk to border communities.
The situation remains highly tense, and it is anticipated that Cambodia may be preparing for a major military operation prior to entering negotiations.
The latest tragic incident indicates that a Cambodian BM-21 rocket struck the area of Sao Thong Chai Subdistrict, Kantharalak District, Si Sa Ket Province, causing damage to civilian homes and resulting in one fatality and one injury. Military personnel provided initial first aid at the scene and transported the injured individual to Si Sa Ket Hospital for further treatment.
