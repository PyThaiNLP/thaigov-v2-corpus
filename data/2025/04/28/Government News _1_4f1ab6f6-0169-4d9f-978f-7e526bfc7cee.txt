PM’s to make field visit prior to cabinet retreat
April 28, 2025, Government Spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub disclosed about the cabinet retreat to be held on April 29, 2025, prior to which cabinet members have been making field visits to the Upper Northeast to follow up on the progress of projects/works under their respective responsibilities.
At 1000hrs today, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra will also make her field visit to Bueng Nong Harn Lake and Don Kern Park in Mueang District, Sakon Nakhon Province to follow up on related development progress, management, and recovery plan. Nong Han Wetland is the Northeast’s largest freshwater lake and the second largest in Thailand. It is an important habitat and breeding and nursery ground for both local species of fish and those that seasonally migrate from the Mekong River, as well as at least 180 species of birds and aquatic plants. Aside from being a major food and income source for the community, Nong Harn also serves as a monkey cheek/ water retention area to prevent and alleviate flood.
The Prime Minister will be briefed on the community’s way of leveraging natural resources and biodiversity to promote sustainable use of Nong Harn Wetland, which is in line with the Government’s policy to promote balanced ecosystem for the benefit of local communities in the upper Northeastern region.
In the afternoon, the Prime Minister will pay a visit to Nakhon Phanom Province’s Wat That Prasit Handicraft Center, aka. the "Na Wha Model under the Royal Initiative on Sustainable Fashion" which is aimed at developing local arts and culture as soft power.
Later at 1500hrs, the Prime Minister will travel to Mekong River in the area of Nakhon Phanom’s Art Samat subdistrict to have a meeting with the Mekong Riverine Unit (Nakhon Phanom) and relevant authorities on anti-narcotics operation and border management.
