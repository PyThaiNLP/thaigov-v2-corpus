Cabinet acknowledges FAA’s upgrade of Thai aviation status
April 22, 2025, at 1200hrs, at the Command Building, Government House, following the weekly cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra disclosed about the issue regarding compensation provided to the quake victims that she has instructed concerned agencies, i.e., the Comptroller General’s Department, the Department of Disaster Mitigation and Prevention, and BMA’s Department of Public Works and Town & ountry Planning, to see whether compensation payment regulation and criteria can be revised to become more flexible, and to ensure that the compensation is not redundant with the compensation received from insurance companies.
The Prime Minister also disclosed the cabinet’s approval of the revision of Foreign Business Act, as proposed by Office of Council of State, to better facilitate relocation of businesses of the future, e.g. startups, which require the work of experts in the areas of advanced technology or online service technology for the development of various applications to increase the country's economic competitiveness.
The cabinet also approved Memorandum of Understanding between Ministry of Environment of the Kingdom of Cambodia and Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Kingdom of Thailand on Cooperation on Transboundary Environmental Pollution. The MoU aims to prevent and mitigate impact of transboundary pollution, air and water pollution, hazardous waste and others, through the exchange of related knowledge and practices.
The cabinet also approved the Government’s FY2025 central fund for emergency and contingency, at the budget framework of 7,404.34 million Baht, for the implementation of 2,748 water resource management capacity enhancement projects as a preparation for drought disaster. Additional 781.884 million Baht was also approved and would be allocated from the Government’s FY2025 central fund for emergency and contingency as flood relief payment to 86,876 households in 17 provinces who were affected by flood disaster during the rainy season of 2024, as proposed by Ministry of Interior.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport also reported to the cabinet that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has upgraded Thailand’s aviation status from category 2 to 1 which means airlines originated from Thailand will be allowed to launch direct flights to the U.S. This is expected to result in an increase of flights and reduction of travel expenses, thereby, enhancing Thailand’s chance of becoming the region’s aviation.
