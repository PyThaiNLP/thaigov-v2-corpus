April 14, 2025, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra delivered a statement on occasion of the 2025 National Elderly Day and Family Day to convey well wishes to all the elderly people and concerned individuals and sectors who have contributed to the strengthening of family institutions.
According to the Prime Minister, the Government has placed great importance on human resource development and capacity building, and strives to ensure healthiness and wellbeing of the Thai people of all genders, groups, and ages. It also commits to creating public awareness on the importance of the elderlies, caring and giving them love and understanding to boost their morale, wellbeing and better quality of life. The elderly people, with their lifelong experiences and knowledge, are pillars and shoulders to lean on for other members of a family.
The Government has provided a number of welfares for the elderlies in line with the ongoing ageing society situation. The Prime minister also offered her moral support to all the elderlies and members of the families. She wished them love, happiness, and strong hearts, and encouraged them to treat one another with love, care, kindness, respect, honor, and immunity.
On occasion of the ‘National Elderly Day’ and ‘Family Day’ of 2025, may the power of the Triple Gem and the sacred beings that one respects and worships bless all the elderly people with strong willpower, healthiness, and protection from all kinds of dangers. May all the Thai families be strong, warm, and happy forever.
