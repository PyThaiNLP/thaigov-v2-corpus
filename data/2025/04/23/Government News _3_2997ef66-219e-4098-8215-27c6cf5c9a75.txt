Number of tourists soars during Songkran Festival
April 16, 2028, Deputy Government Spokesperson Sasikarn Watthanachan disclosed that Thailand saw a significant increase in the number of foreign tourists in the past week (+17.61%) during Songkran Holiday celebrations.
This year the Government has organized the grand celebrations of “Maha Songkran World Water Festival 2025” in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Khon Kaen, and Hat Yai, which attracted a large number of foreign tourists, especially those from the nearby markets, e.g., China and India. More tourists from Europe (e.g., Germany, France, etc.) are also coming in during their school spring break.
The number of incoming foreign tourists recorded between April 6-12, 2025 is 666,180, an increase of 64,564 people, or 10.73% from the previous week, accounting for an average of 95,169 tourists per day.
Top 5 countries with the most tourists visiting Thailand are:
1. Malaysia (102,106 people)
2. China (82,274 people)
3. India (55,158 people)
4. Russia (40,283 people)
5. United Kingdom (32,119 people)
The number of tourists from China, India, Malaysia and Russia have increased by 28.20%, 23.56%, 10.67% and 8.40% respectively, while tourists from the United Kingdom saw a slight decline of 8.49%.
From January 1 to April 13, 2025, Thailand received a total of 10,738,424 tourists, generating over 516,589 million Baht in tourism revenue. Top 5 countries with the highest number of tourists during the period are:
1. China (1,470,834)
2. Malaysia (1,333,596)
3. Russia (801,532)
4. India (631,820)
5. South Korea (533,752)
Although the number of tourists is expected to drop next week after the end of Songkran festival, Thai tourism will still be boosted by other supporting factors, such as, school holidays in Europe, announcement of the campaign “Amazing Thailand Grand Tourism and Sports Year 2025”, suspension of TM6 form for travelers, an increase of incoming flights, and the Government’s other “ease of traveling” measures.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, the Government continues to push forward tourism promotion to attract quality tourists, generate incomes, and distribute economic opportunities to all regions. Thailand is ready to become a world-class destination that tourists trust and want to revisit.
