PM: ASEAN to work together on US tax negotiations
April 29, 2025, at 1130hrs, at Mekong Subregion Conference Hall, Nakhon Phanom University, following the cabinet retreat for the Upper Northeastern Provincial Cluster 2 (Nakhon Phanom, Sakon Nakhon, and Mukdaharn), Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra disclosed about ASEAN cooperation in response to US President Trump’s reciprocal tariff policy that she has discussed with the Prime Ministers of Cambodia and Malaysia, especially on the possibility to leverage with ASEAN’s combined population and abundant natural resources. This matter will also be raised at the Joint Cabinet Retreat (JCR) between Thailand and Cambodia to be held soon in Sakaeo province.
On the concern that US tariff negotiation might be hindered by the Thai authorities' arrest of American scholar Paul Chambers, the Prime Minister responded that Ministry of Foreign Affairs will work together with Ministry of Commerce on the big picture of the negotiation. The negotiation date is yet to finalize as the most important point is accuracy of relevant myriad details which concerned authorities are working on. The Prime Minister also denounced a rumor on the negotiation date never being set at the first place, affirming cordial relations between Thailand and the US and constant contact between the two sides on the matter.
