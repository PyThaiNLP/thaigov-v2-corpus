Ministry of Tourism and Sports’ “Ease of Traveling” roadmap aimed to provide one-stop services to tourists
March 28, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed that the cabinet acknowledged the progress of “Ease of Traveling” roadmap, implemented by Ministry of Tourism and Sports in accordance with the cabinet’s resolution on August 3, 2021 which assigned government agencies to introduce public e-services in 12 lines of service.
Ministry of Tourism and Sports’ “2022-2024 Ease of Traveling” roadmap was developed from the existing web portal “Entry Thailand”, which provided information related to traveling to Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was later upgraded to a central platform providing post-COVID-19 one-stop services and information on prior to the arrival, arrival/during the stay, and before leave.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, “Entry Thailand” website links with other systems/applications of concerned agencies to better facilitate foreign tourists, i.e., Ministry of Digital Economy and Society’s “Thailand Pass”, the Revenue Office’s tax refund system, Customs Office’s online visa application system, Tourism Police’s “Tourist Police I Lert U” application, Airports of Thailand PCL’s flight schedule system, Department of Disease Control’s system on COVID-19 vaccination, and Office of Insurance Commission’s insurance scheme for COVID-19 prevention and protection.
In 2023, Ministry of Tourism and Sports is set to expand the website’s scope of services through linkages with more agencies, such as Ministry of Culture (in relation to Thailand’s festivals and celebrations), Fine Arts Department (for information related to museums and historical parks), Department of Disaster Mitigation and Prevention (for information related to daily disaster warning), the Thai Meteorological Department (in relation to Thailand’s weather forecast), and Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (for information related to reservation of national park accommodations).
Ministry of Tourism and Sports has also a plan to upgrade and promote the Ease of Traveling services among the wider public, as well as conduct data analysis on tourist satisfaction, behavior, and demand to be able to enhance efficiency, and plan for the future tourism roadmaps.
