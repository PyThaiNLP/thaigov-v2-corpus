The renewed MOU was sign on April 20, 2022 with the effective period of 5 years. The MOU prescribes exchanging information and experiences on field of waste management policy development and implementation, e.g., recycling technology and innovation, ash management, and contaminated area management, etc. On February 22, 2023, a meeting was held to discuss capacity enhancement of Thailand’s field of waste management, and to learn from Japan on “waste to energy” technology.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister thanked all concerned agencies on the progress in field of waste management, and affirmed the Thai Government’s commitment to promote bilateral cooperation with Japan in the fields of mutual interest. Thailand’s cooperation with Japan on field of waste management is part of the effort to promote joint industrial development in the region, and foster environmentally-friendly businesses and optimum use of energy, in line with the Government’s policy on green industry and BCG Economic Model, for the country to achieve balance, stability, and sustainability
