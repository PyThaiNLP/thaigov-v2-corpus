March 13, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha is pleased with an increase in the number of applications for intellectual property (IP) protection during 2020-2022 despite the COVID-19 situation, most of which are patent filing for medicine and medical products, and COVID-19 prevention products.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the total of 66,580, 61,984, and 60,082 applications were recorded for IP registration in 2020, 2021, and 2022 respectively. As a result, the World Intellectual Property Organization ranks Thailand as 43rd among the 132 economies (3rd in ASEAN) in its Global Innovation Index (GII).
The Prime Minister is confident in the capability and innovativeness of Thai people. IP filing will give them commercial advantage that could be built upon for value added. An increase in the number of IP applications is a boost for the development of the Thai economy in a stable and sustainable manner.
