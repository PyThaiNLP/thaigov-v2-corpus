Cabinet approves financial support of USD15,000/year for APEC BCG Award
February 28, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed that the
cabinet approved voluntary financial support to Thailand’s APEC Bio-Circular-Green (BCG)
Award on an annual basis, at up to USD15,000/year. The budget will be allocated from Ministry
of Foreign Affairs’ budget from FY 2024 onward.
There will be 3 award categories under the APEC Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Award, namely, for
women, youth, and MSMEs. Each award recipient will be prized with USD5,000, voluntarily
sponsored by APEC economies. The Award will open for nominations in March 2023, while
selection of winners is planned in the latter part of the year. The Award winners will be
announced at the 2023 APEC Ministerial Meeting to be held in San Francisco, U.S.A.
As the APEC Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Award is initiated by Thailand, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
proposed for the country’s regular funding of USD15,000/year from FY2024 onward to ensure
continuation in the implementation of the Bangkok Goals on Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Economy,
and to create awareness on the BCG economic model.
