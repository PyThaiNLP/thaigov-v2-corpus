​Thailand ready to host international meetings and events
February 27, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was pleased with Thailand’s hosting of 2 major international events, which demonstrates the confidence and recognition of the global community on the country’s capability.
Thailand has been chosen to host the 62nd annual Congress of the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) in November 2023, and the Annual General Meeting 2023 of Asian Federation of Exhibition and Convention Associations (AFECA AGM 2023) in October 2023 in Bangkok. The latter will be organized under the theme: “ASIA UNITES”, and will be participated by members from 155 organizations and 19 countries. Hosting of the international events is believed to generate considerable income to drive forward economic recovery.
Thailand’s hosting of AFECA AGM 2023 would be a good opportunity for the region’s MICE business leaders and experts to gather and exchange views and knowledge in order to promote Asia’s MICE business at a global level.
The Prime Minister believes that MICE industry will be one of the nation’s economic drivers, in parallel with which, the soft power policy and the BCG Economic Model can also be pushed forward. Each international event held in Thailand, be it, ICCA Congress 2023, International Horticultural Expo 2026 in Udon Thani, or the Expo 2028 Phuket, will be a good opportunity for the country to showcase its capability and potential, as well as the nation’s culture and identities.
