March 8, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that the cabinet, in its meeting on March 7, 2023, has made approval to the establishment of Office of Research and Innovation for Competitiveness and Area-Based Development (Public Organization) under Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation.
According to the Government Spokesperson, prior to 2019, there were four agencies – the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), the National Innovation Agency (NIA), the Agricultural Research Development Agency (ARDA) and the Health Systems Research Institute (HSRI) – responsible for administering public research fund in Thailand. Each agency already had specific funding scope which collectively was insufficient to fulfil overarching areas required to transform Thailand into an innovation-based economy. As part of the higher education, science, research and innovation system reform, the National Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation Policy Council decided to establish three program management units (PMUs) as independent funding bodies operating under the legal framework of the Office of National Higher Education Science Research and Innovation Policy Council (NXPO). The 3 PMUs, namely, (1) Program Management Unit for Area-based Development (PMU-A); (2) Program Management Unit for Human Resources & Institutional Development, Research and Innovation (PMU-B); and (3) Program Management Unit for Competitiveness Enhancement (PMU-C), will be merged into Office of Research and Innovation for Competitiveness and Area-Based Development (Public Organization).
Office of Research and Innovation for Competitiveness and Area-Based Development (Public Organization) will be the country’s major funding management agency for the development of technology and innovation. The aim is to enhance the nation’s industrial competitiveness; promote area-based development and human resources & institutional development.
The cabinet also approved in principle the draft Royal Decree on the establishment of Office of Research and Innovation for Competitiveness and Area-Based Development (Public Organization), as proposed by Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation. The Ministry is also ordered to take into consideration comments of Office of National Economic and Social Development Council, and Office of the Public Sector Development Commission.
