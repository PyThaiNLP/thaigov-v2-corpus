March 26, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed that the
Royal Thai Police, through the Tourist Police Office, has developed a mobile application called
“Tourist  Police i lert u” for foreign visitors to Thailand to be able to seek help from the police in
cases of emergency. The application is operated with the Global positioning System (GPS), and
can be downloaded free of charge from both iOS and android systems.
Once downloaded, tourists may click “Request” to seek help, and send information and photos
at the scene of accident to the War Room (1155 tourist police Hotline), which has officers
standing by 24/7. The information will, then, be forwarded to local police nearby to provide
immediate help. In the meantime, the police will call back to the registered phone number to
provide initial help and advice. Languages available for communication with the tourist police
are: English, Chinese, Russian, Korean, French, German, ASEAN, and Arabic.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, the Government strives to increase safety
of all the tourists in Thailand. Technology has been applied to enhance operation efficiency and
prompt assistance. Tourists who are planning to visit Thailand are invited to download the
application to receive help from the Thai police in case of emergency.
