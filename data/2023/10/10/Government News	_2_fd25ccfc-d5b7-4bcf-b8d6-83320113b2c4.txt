and other concerned agencies to expedite their repatriation.

Embassy in Tel Aviv reported that the first group of 15 Thais, some of whom suffer an injury, is
scheduled to be back in Thailand by a commercial flight on October 12. The embassy also

taken Thai nationals hostage to negotiate for their release, and emphasized that the most
important thing now is the safety of Thai nationals. Thailand is friend to and has cordial
relations with all sides, and wishes to see the violence ending, and the situation returning to
normalcy soon.
