Thailand and Laos to strengthen cooperation on trade, infrastructure connectivity, and anti-transboundary haze
October 30, 2023, at 0835hrs (Vientiane local time), at the Prime Minister Office, Vientiane, Laos, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Srettha Thavisin attended an official welcoming ceremony and a plenary meeting with Lao Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone. Government Spokesperson Chai Wacharonke disclosed gist of the meeting as follows:
The two Prime Ministers expressed pleasure to meet with each other and discussed the following issues of mutual cooperation:
Trade cooperation: The Thai Prime Minister committed to promote economic linkages between Lao PDR and Thailand’s Northeastern region as the “Growth Area”, and was of the view that both countries seek proper measures to reduce trade obstacles and to speed up trade facilitation between each other in a bid to achieve trade target of US$11 billion by 2025. Thailand stands ready to host a meeting between the country’s Ministry of Commerce and Lao Ministry of Industry and Trade to further discuss trade cooperation.
Infrastructure connectivity: The Prime Minister affirmed Thailand’s commitment to support the Lao counterpart’s policy to transform from “Land-locked” to “Land-linked”, and to work together with Laos in various infrastructure development projects in order to promote transport connectivity between the two countries.
The Prime Minister urged to expedite negotiation on the construction detail of railway bridge across Mekong River (Nong Khai-Vientiane), for which Thailand would provide special interest rate loans. Additionally, drafting of the technical arrangement for railway operations between Thailand’s Thanaleng Station and the Vientiane Station (Khamsavath) should be accelerated in a bid for the project to be commenced by early next year, which is expected to boost travel and tourism between Thailand and Laos.
Regarding road and bridge connectivity, the Prime Minister was pleased with progress of the 5th Friendship Bridge project (Bueng Kan - Bolikhamxay) which is almost complete, and the 6th Friendship Bridge project (Ubon Ratchathani to Salavan) on which the two sides agreed in principle. Improvement of Highway No. 12 (Nakhon Phanom / Khammouane province’s Thakhek, Bolikhamxay’s Na Pao / Chalo, Quang Binh in Vietnam) is also in progress to further facilitate transport between Thailand – Laos – Vietnam – China, and to boost local economy along the route.
The Prime Minister urged the two sides to work together in enhancing transport and logistics efficiency for time and cost optimization, and called on Lao PDR’s concerned agency to consider permitting Thai trailer trucks to transport goods into the country as they did before COVID-19. Laos was also requested to determine exact handling charges at Vientiane Logistic Park (VLP) in order for Thai businesses to be able to plan ahead.
Transboundary haze pollution: Both parties placed importance on the issue and came to terms on expediting a Joint Action Plan between Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar, which would help mitigate haze impact on people’s health. Thailand also stands ready to support Laos in the development of Fire Risk Map and staff training.
Clean energy: The Prime Minister expressed interest to purchase more clean energy from Laos to accommodate expansion of domestic industries.
Following the meeting, both the Prime Ministers witnessed the signing of important documents and handover ceremonies as follows:
Signing of an MOU on Cultural Exchange between Thailand’s Ministry of Culture and Lao PDR’s Ministry of Information, Culture, and Tourism
Signing of Record of Discussions between NEDA and Lao National Railway for the Technical Assistance for the Capacity Building for Locomotive Driving and Ticketing System and Development of a Business Model for the Lao National Railway
