November 29, 2023, Government Spokesperson Chai Wacharoke clarified that Google, Microsoft, and Tesla had never negotiated with the Thai government to reduce electricity prices before deciding to invest in Thailand.
Government Spokesperson revealed that the three companies had never discussed reducing electricity bills. The most important condition for these global companies is clean energy for production. The issue of climate change and global warming has been challenging the world; thus, the Thai government is ready to support these companies with clean energy and green energy.

The Government Spokesperson emphasized that the Thai government has projects related to environmental protection that align with the working methods of these large global companies.
