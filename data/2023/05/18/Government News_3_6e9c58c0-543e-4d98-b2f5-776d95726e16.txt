May 18, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed about another accomplishment in trade and investment promotion cooperation between Thailand and China, following the success of the “Invest in Shanghai, Share the Future” event, co-organized by the City of Shanghai, Bank of China, and Thailand’s Board of Investment (BOI).
The Mayor of Shanghai led a group of Shanghai executives to attend the “Invest in Shanghai, Share the Future” event which was held in Thailand on May 2, 2023 with an aim to expand trade and investment cooperation and build upon BOI’s investment roadshows in several Chinese cities in April 2023. According to BOI, Thailand remains popular among Chinese investors, with its strategic location in the region, efficient transport, logistics, and infrastructure system, and quality industrial estates, especially the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) which could connect with Shanghai Lingang Special Area in the future.
Shanghai has also a policy to attract investment in Shanghai Lin-gang Special Area, which specializes in modern industries, such as digital ventures, health and medicine, smart electronics and EVs. This would be a great opportunity to strengthen investment cooperation between Thailand and China, as these industries are in line with Thailand's policy to promote S-Curve industry development.
The Prime Minister is pleased with steady growth in trade and investment cooperation between the two countries, especially the investment in future industries. The Government Spokesperson affirmed that 3 BOI offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou stand ready to further strengthen trade and investment connectivity between Thailand and China.
