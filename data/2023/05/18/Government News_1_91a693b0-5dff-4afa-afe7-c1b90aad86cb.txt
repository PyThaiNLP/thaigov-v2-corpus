May 16, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha commended the performances and fighting spirit of Thailand’s 32nd SEA Games squad, and urged the Thai people to give them moral support until the end of the event.
As of May 16, 2023 at 22.20 hrs, Thailand received 312 medals at the 32nd SEA Games (108 golds, 96 silvers, and 108 bronzes). Although the country ranks 2nd on the medal table, Thailand fares best in the more internationally recognized sports competitions, especially Taekwondo, Judo, and women’s volleyball. While Thai men’s football was upset by Indonesia in the final match, they also did their best.
According to the Government Spokesperson, as the 32nd SEA Games is coming to an end, the Prime Minister thanked all the Thai athletes, on behalf of the Thai people, for fighting to the best of their ability, whether or not they received a medal at the tournament. The event’s closing ceremony will take place in the evening of May 17, 2023, during which Thailand will be handed over with the SEAGF flag to host the 33rd SEA Games in 2025 in Bangkok, Chonburi, and Songkhla.
