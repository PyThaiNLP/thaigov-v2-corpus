May it Please Your Majesty,
I, General Prayut Chan-o-cha, as Prime Minister and on behalf of the Council of Ministers and our spouses, government officials, diplomatic representatives, and the Thai people, have the esteemed honour to express our loyalty and devotion to Your Majesty on this most auspicious occasion.
Ever since Your Majesty’s accession to the Throne as the 10th Monarch of the Chakri Dynasty, Your Majesty has been dedicated to undertaking countless activities with extraordinary virtuosity and unwavering commitment for the progress and prosperity of the Thai nation. Your Majesty’s benevolence has supported a better quality of life for all and promoted the well-being of the Thai people, especially for those in need. Your Majesty’s life guidelines for the Thai people have been an inspiration to the nation, which we shall be forever grateful for.
On this most auspicious occasion, we humbly ask for Your Majesty’s gracious permission to bestow us the opportunity to convey our highest felicitations to Your Majesty, and invite the power of the Triple Gems and all things sacred to maintain Your Majesty with the Four Glorious Blessings and happiness, and with the aspiration for Your Majesty’s benevolence and grace to resplendently reign throughout our nation.
In this connection, I humbly ask for Your Majesty’s permission to invite all the dignitaries gathered here today, to join me in offering a toast in praise and in tribute to Your Majesty, for the everlasting happiness and prosperity of our nation.
I have the distinguished honour to remain Your Majesty’s most faithful and dutiful subject.
General Prayut Chan-o-cha (Ret.),
Prime Minister
