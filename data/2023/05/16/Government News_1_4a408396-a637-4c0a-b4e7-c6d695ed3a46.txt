May 15, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed that Office of the Election Commission (EC) has warned voters who were unable to cast ballots on May 14, 2023 to notify concerned authority of their reason within 7 days after the election date (May 15-21) in order to avoid suspension of certain rights.
Notification can be made by filling out a form or sending a letter, specifying their name, ID no., and address (as appeared in the house registration) via registered mail (or personally handing it) to district/local authority. They may also clarify the reason via an application “Smart Vote” or the website: www.bora.dopa.go.th/all-election.
The Deputy Government Spokesperson added that failure to inform polling authority of the reason why they were unable to cast vote, although not considering illegal, would rid them of their rights to: 1) file a petition against election of an MP; 2) register as MP, local councilor, local administrator or senator candidate; 3) register as candidate for village/subdistrict head; 4) hold position as government official and parliamentary official; and 5) hold position as deputy local administrator, secretary to local administrator, assistant secretary to local administrator, chief advisor to local administrator, advisor to local administrator, or member of local administrative advisory board.
Suspension of the above rights will take effect for 2 years after the election date. However, if a failure to vote without informing of the reason is repeated during the suspension period, the 2-year rights restriction will start all over again from the latest election date.
