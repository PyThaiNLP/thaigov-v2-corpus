Govt to give away condoms for universal healthcare card (gold card) holders
May 16, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed about the Government’s concern on public healthcare, especially sexual health, i.e., sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancy. Free distribution of condoms is a privilege under the National Health Security System, or the 30-Baht health scheme, to prevent unwanted pregnancy and transmission of sexual diseases among people in the reproductive ages. Ten condoms/week (not exceeding 52 weeks/person/year) will be offered to universal healthcare card (gold card) holders. National Health Security Office is also considering the same privilege for those under the social security system and government official welfare system.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, vending machines for distribution of free condoms will initially be installed at: 1) Bali Hai Pier in Pattaya, Chonburi; 2) Pattaya City Hospital, Chonburi; 3) Thammasat University, Tha Phachan Campus, Bangkok; 4) Tonsak Market, Nonthaburi; 5) Suk Anan Park Shopping Mall, Saraburi; 6) Faculty of Pharmacy, Rangsit University; and 7) Central Festival Shopping Mall, Pattaya.
