July 13, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Tipanan Sirichana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was pleased with the outcome of a survey conducted by the International Living magazine on the World’s Best Places to Retire in 2023 and the 2023 Annual Global Retirement Index, according to which Thailand ranks 9th.
The 2023 Annual Global Retirement Index is informed by hundreds of opinions and real-life experiences—information—compiled by the magazine’s trusted sources in the best retirement destinations across the globe. Top 10 Best Places to Retire in 2023 according to the magazine’s compilation are: 1) Portugal; 2) Mexico; 3) Panama; 4) Ecuador; 5) Costa Rica; 6) Spain; 7) Greece; 8) France; 9) Italy and Thailand; and 10) Colombia. Thailand is the only country from Asia that stands in the top 10.
The International Living stated that Thailand is not only a popular destination for retirees, but also the expats who look for a place with an affordable cost of living yet manifesting an enriched way of life. Thai economy is also on the rising trend. Coupling with its location at the heart of Southeast Asia, Thailand has become one of the world’s international business hubs.
Likewise, the website: www.numbeo.com, a crowd-sourced global database of perceived cost of living, property prices, and quality of life, has conducted a comparative compilation on the cost of living in ASEAN’s 5 big cities, and Bangkok scores 44.29, while Singapore is 85.87, Ho Chi Minh City, 36.47, Jakarta, 35.25, and Kuala Lumpur 35.71.
