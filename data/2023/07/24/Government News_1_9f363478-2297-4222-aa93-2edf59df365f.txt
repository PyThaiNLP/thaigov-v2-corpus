Typhoon “Doksuri” will not hit Thailand
Typhoon “Doksuri” will not hit Thailand
July 23, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed Thailand Meteorological Department’s announcement on the tropical storm “Doksuri” (upgraded to typhoon as of the evening of July 23).
According to the announcement, Doksuri is moving northwestward in the Pacific Ocean (east of the Philippines), and is forecasted to approach Taiwan during July 26-28, 2023. Those who plan their travel to Taiwan during the period are strongly advised to check the weather condition before traveling. Although Doksuri will not directly hit Thailand, it will exacerbate monsoon conditions during July 29- August 1 with heavy rainfall being forecasted. Nevertheless, the situation may change, and the public is urged to closely follow up on the update from Thailand Meteorological Department.
During July 23-25, 2023, isolated heavy rains are possible in the lower Northeast, Central, the East, the upper South, Bangkok and vicinity, and the South (west coast), which may result in flash flood. The rather strong southwest monsoon still prevails, while monsoon trough lies across Thailand. Coupling with the low-pressure cell covering the coast of Vietnam, rather strong and strong wind is forecasted both in the east and west coasts of the Southern Thailand throughout the week.
The Deputy Government Spokesperson added that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has closely followed up on the water situation, especially in the South. He has been reported on the preparedness by all concerned sectors and agencies, and advised them to work in an integrative manner and give the public advance notifications for their precaution.
