Govt hopes to elevate Thailand as hub of ASEAN films
July 17, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Tipanan Sirichana disclosed that Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has handed down a policy to promote
Thailand’s soft power by leveraging cultural strength to reinforce international relations and
create revenues to the country. He also acknowledged the success of the Thai Film Festival in
Malaysia 2023, which was held under the theme: “Bridging Thainess to International Audience”
during July 13-16, 2023. Attending the event press conference at GSC Mid Vally cinemas, Kuala
Lumpur were guests of honor from Malaysia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Tourism,
Arts and Culture, National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (FINAS), the diplomatic
corps, Malaysian media, students, academic personnel, and Thai and Malaysian public
audiences. The Film Festival not only promoted friendship and international relations, but also
the country’s creative economy and future cooperation between film industries of the two
countries.
During the past 7 years (2016-2022), Thailand hit the record in attracting foreign filming
productions, which earned the country over 26 billion Baht. The cabinet, in its meeting dated
February 7, 2023, also approved special incentives for foreign filming production in the country,
which include 20-30% cash rebate for 2 years, in a bid to promote Bangkok as the hub of
ASEAN films.
The Thai Film Festival in Malaysia 2023, which was held under the theme: “Bridging Thainess to
International Audience”, featured 5 five renowned films from Thailand, namely; Faces of Anne,
Love Destiny the Movie, Fast and Feel Love, Haunted Universities 2nd Semester, and an all-time
Malaysians’ favorite classic Rom-Com, Friend Zone. The public screening took place at four
selected GSC cinemas in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, and Putrajaya, which are GSC Mid Valley, GSC
1 Utama, GSC My Town, and GSC IOI City Mall.
