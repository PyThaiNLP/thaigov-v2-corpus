​PM pleased with increase of consumer confidence index in June 2023
July 14, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Tipanan Sirichana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was pleased with the consumer confidence index in June 2023, as reported by the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, which further increased for the 13th month to 56.7 from 55.7 in the previous month, the highest in 40 months since March 2020. The increase is supported by continued recovery in the tourism sector. Coupling with gasoline price reduction, the consumers feel more at ease with the cost of living, thereby, their confidence is significantly boosted in all indicators.
A rise in the consumer confidence index reflects the recovering economy with more spending and investment. As for tourism, which is the country’s growth engine, Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has aimed for the 100% recovery of tourism sector in 2024, the same level as pre-COVID-19. With this, total revenue earned from tourism activities is expected at 3,098,606 million Baht or 16% of the GDP.
The Deputy Government Spokesperson added that the measures implemented under the Prime Minister’s policies, be it, economic stimulus measures, infrastructure development, public sector investment promotion, etc., have contributed to the growth of labor market and more revenues earned, leading to the more confidence of consumers and better livelihood.
