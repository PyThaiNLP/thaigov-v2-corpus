​Thai Ambassador to Saudi Arabia appointed as Permanent Representative to OIC and GCC Coordinator
July 18, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed that the cabinet, in its meeting today, approved for the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Thailand to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to take the positions of Thai Permanent Representative (PR) to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and Coordinator between Thailand and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
With regards to the relations between Thailand and the two organizations, OIC comprises 57 sovereign Muslim States, and Thailand has gained “Observer Status” from the OIC on October 1, 1998, as the country aims to create good understanding on the issue of conflict in Southern Thailand, and strengthen productive relations with the Muslim world. GCC has 6 member states, namely, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the State of Kuwait, the Sultanate of Oman, the State of Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Thailand has forged close bilateral ties with the GCC member states, as they are the country's most significant crude oil and natural gas exporters.
Thailand had never appointed a Permanent Representative to the OIC, and the GCC Coordinator. However, following the normalization of diplomatic relations between Thailand and Saudi Arabia in 2022, and the appointment of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Thailand to Saudi Arabia, it would be appropriate to appoint the Thai Ambassador to Saudi Arabia to also take the positions of Thai Permanent Representative to the OIC, and the GCC Coordinator in a bid to affirm Thailand’s commitment in prioritizing closer and more dynamic relations with both the OIC and the GCC. This will also indirectly benefit Thailand – Saudi Arabia’s bilateral relations as the latter is key member to both the organizations. The current Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Thailand to Saudi Arabia is Mr. Darm Boontham.
