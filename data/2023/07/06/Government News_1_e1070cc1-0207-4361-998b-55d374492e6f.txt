Cabinet approves restructuring and renaming of Department of
Environmental Quality Promotion
July 5, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government
Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that the cabinet has made approval to the draft
Royal Decree on Government Agency Division for Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environment’s Department of Environmental Quality Promotion, B.E. …, and the draft Royal
Decree on Government Agency Division for Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment’s
Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning, B.E. …
Under the Royal Decree, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment’s Department of
Environmental Quality Promotion will be renamed as “Department of Climate Change and
Environment (กรมการเปลี่ยนแปลงสภาพภูมิอากาศและสิ่งแวดล้อม)” to be in line with the
restructuring of the Department’s mission as public agency responsible for climate change
management.
With the worsening climate change situation, Thailand has to cope with ensuing economic,
social and environmental problems. Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has,
therefore, reviewed and restructured agencies responsible for climate change to be in line with
the changing economic, social and environmental contexts. As a result, the mission of Office of
Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning’s Division of Climate Change
Management and Coordination will be integrated with that of the Department of Environmental
Quality Promotion. Roles and authority of the Department of Environmental Quality Promotion
will be revised accordingly, and the Department will subsequently be renamed as Department of
Climate Change and Environment.
