sustainable tourism and cultural heritages
July 6, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government
Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen.
Prayut Chan-o-cha congratulated the signing of an MOU between the Designated Areas for
Sustainable Tourism Administration (Public Organization) and the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which he hoped to be a good opportunity for
promotion of sustainable tourism and local development for cultural and natural heritage sites,
as well as for Creative Cities and additional tourism destinations in Thailand.
DASTA and UNESCO initiated their collaboration through the signing of the first MoU in 2014,
which was later renewed in 2019, to promote sustainable development at heritage sites in
Thailand. Implementations under the MOU include organization of workshop on utilization of
“Visitor Management Assessment and Strategy Tool (VMAST)” in Thailand and other APEC
countries among others.
The latest MOU, signed on June 28, 2023, will focus on selected designated areas under the
responsibility of DASTA as pilot sites. Activities will include capacity-building and safeguarding of
tangible and intangible heritage, and the launch of a UNESCO-DASTA project, funded by the
ASEAN-Türkiye Cooperation, titled ‘Achieving Sustainable Tourism with Intangible Cultural
Heritage and Creative Cities Network in Waterway Cities of ASEAN’ in August of this year.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister pledged his support to all
cooperations that benefit the world and mankind. Collaboration between DASTA and UNESCO to
promote sustainable tourism and cultural heritages would not only engender social, community,
and environmental responsibility, but also ecosystem security, conservation of culture heritages,
and balanced tourism development in parallel with national economic development.
