Govt warns public against falling prey to cyber scams as number
of investment fraud cases increase
Deputy Government Spokesperson warned the public against falling prey to scammers,
especially through various types of investment frauds.
According to the Royal Thai Police’s data collected from its website: www.thaipoliceonline.com,
which is opened for the public to submit cybercrime complaints online, investment fraud-related
cases submitted during March 1 and June 30, 2023 account for as many as 23,616 cases, worth
over 11.55 billion Baht. In June alone, 876 cases were reported with the amount lost to these
scams at over 600 million Baht.
In a bid to reinforce the public’s cyber immunity, the Government has launched the websites:
www.เตือนภัยออนไลน์.com, and a Facebook page: “เตือนภัยออนไลน์”, to publicize various types
of possible cyber scams and investment frauds. The public may seek further advice via the
Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau’s Hotline 1441 or call 081-866-3000. Those who fell prey to
any investment fraud are advised to contact their bank to cancel illicit financial transaction. The
bank will, then, issue a Bank ID via SMS which the victim may refer to in reporting to the police
immediately. They may also report the case via www.thaipoliceonline.com.
