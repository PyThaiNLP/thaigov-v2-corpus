Govt warns of fake links claiming "Social Security Office" informs to update information to "withdraw social security contribution before maturity."
April 24, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed that regarding the release of a video clip detailing that "the elderly will receive a special allowance of 2,500 baht per person at the end of April" in such a case, the Department of Older Persons (DOP) of the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security clarified that there was no change in the monthly allowance or any special allowance for senior citizens because the current criteria still adhere to the Regulations of the Ministry of Interior on Criteria for Elderly Allowance Payment of Local Administrative Organizations by paying an allowance on a monthly basis according to age range.
In addition, the Deputy Government Spokesperson warns about criminal SMS messages claiming to be "Social Security Office" and informs employers and employees to urgently update information to withdraw social security contributions before maturity by attaching a link to fill out the information. The Deputy Government Spokesperson emphasizes that do not click on the link because it is a trick to take control of the mobile phone and transfer money from the user's bank account.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, criminals often impersonate government officials, especially regarding payments. The government warns that please be very careful and conscious about fraudulent information and to check information before sending or sharing it on social media.
