April 23, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed about the National Statistical Office (NSO)’s report on the unemployment rate which is in line with the country’s steady economic recovery.
According to the report, as of February 2023, out of 58.81 million Thai population aged 15 years and over, 40.49 million are in the labor force, whereas the rest (18.32 million) are either students, housewives, houseworkers, or people with disabilities.
Among the workforces, 39.91 million people have been employed, an increase from 39.81 million at the end of 2022, while 360,000 or 0.9% are unemployed, comparing to 390,000 or 1% at the end of 2022. The remaining 220,000 people are seasonal workforces.
The Deputy Government Spokesperson added that the unemployment rate of 0.9% was the lowest rate and was below 1% for the first time in nearly 4 years. The last time Thailand saw a lower-than-1% unemployment rate was in October 2019 (0.9%) prior to the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.
A decrease in the unemployment rate to the same level as pre-COVID-19 pandemic was a policy that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha handed down to concerned agencies. The aim is to maintain people’s employment status and revenue earning. The Government attempts to promote gradual and steady economy recovery without implementing unnecessarily drastic stimulus in a bid to maintain balance between growth and stability and avoid inflation problem
