Thailand’s industry confidence index in March 2023 increased to 97.8 points, the highest for the decade.
April 23, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that the industry confidence index in March 2023 increased to 97.8 points, and was the highest for the decade. Expects the index to rise to 106.3 in the next three months.
The Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) revealed that Thailand’s Industrial Sentiment Index (TISI), which was based on an opinion survey of 1,322 industrial entrepreneurs, covering 45 industrial groups, rose to 97.8 in March 2023 from 96.2 in February 2023, and was the highest since January 2013, because of many positive factors such as the expansion of domestic demand, the expansion of the construction industry sector, regional purchasing power due to an increase in agricultural sector income, and the tourism sector continues to recover as the result of an increase in the number of foreign tourists and government measures to support domestic tourism.
For the next three months, the FTI’s index for industry sentiment is expected to reach 106.3 as the Thai economy expands through the tourism sector and domestic consumption. Besides, the reopening of China’s border is favouring the tourism sector and Thai exports in the second half of this year. On the downside, there are risks from global economic and geopolitical problems.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Government thanks the concerned agencies for the increase in the industrial confidence index and will consider the recommendations from the industrial sector by addressing production cost issues, such as high energy prices, and finding new markets for Thai products.
