April 26, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has closely followed up on the evacuation of Thai citizens from Sudan.
The most recent update revealed 136 Thais and family members, comprising a group of 133 Thais (and 2 foreigner spouses) who were earlier helped by the Royal Thai Embassy in Cairo, and a Thai woman with 2 kids (and an American spouse), awaiting to board a ship in Port Sudan.
The first 82 Thais have already arrived in Jeddah from Port Sudan yesterday (April 25, 2023), and have been transferred by Saudi authority to a naval base.
