PM pleased with Thailand being chosen to host 2026 Annual Meetings of World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund
April 20, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was pleased with the report of Ministry of Finance about Thailand being chosen to host the 2026 Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group (WBG) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which will bring together central bankers, ministers of finance and development, private sector leaders, civil society, media and academics from 190 member countries to discuss the most pressing issues facing the global economy, including the world economic outlook, global financial stability, poverty eradication, inclusive economic growth and job creation, climate change, digitalization, sustainable development and economic growth, and others.
The Meetings are usually held for two consecutive years at the WBG and IMF headquarters in Washington, D.C. and every third year in one of the institutions’ member countries. The upcoming 2023 Annual Meetings will take place this October in Marrakech, Morocco. Thailand has hosted the WBG – IMF Annual Meetings once in 1991.
According to the Government Spokesperson, hosting the 2026 Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group (WBG) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will demonstrate Thailand’s leading role in supporting the international financial institutions, and showcase the country’s readiness as host of international meetings and conferences. It will also be a good opportunity for Thailand to reinforce economic and financial cooperation at both bilateral and multilateral levels. It is expected that the meetings will attract more than 12,000 participants from all over the world which would generate a number of economic activities at the national and local levels.
