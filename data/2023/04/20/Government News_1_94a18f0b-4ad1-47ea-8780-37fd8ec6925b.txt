​Govt strives to solve problem related to rights to Universal Healthcare scheme of Thai people with “No Registration Status"
April 19, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed the Government’s effort to solve the problem of Thai people with “No Registration Status", who have been rid of fundamental rights, especially the rights to Universal Healthcare scheme, as their names are not included in the civil registration system.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, Thai people with “No Registration Status" may undergo 7 steps of national verification process: 1) verifying their registration status; 2) compiling available registration documents, i.e., their own national ID card, national ID cards of parents, birth certificate, house registration that they used to be registered into, relocation document, and other official documents. They may also register their request if these documents are not available; 3) registering their request at district or local registrar of their current residency; 4) initial review of submitted documents by registrars; 5) verifying submitted documents and interrogating witnesses; 6) notifying result; and 7) if birth and nationality cannot be verified, these people may be issued with a profile registration and identification document under type 0 (Section 19/2).
Further information can be acquired from Department Of Provincial Administration’s Bureau of Registration at phone nos. 0-2791-7312-6. People under type 0 (Section 19/2) may inquire about their rights to healthcare protection at the Division of Health Economics and Health Security’s phone no.: 02-590-1577 (official hours only).
