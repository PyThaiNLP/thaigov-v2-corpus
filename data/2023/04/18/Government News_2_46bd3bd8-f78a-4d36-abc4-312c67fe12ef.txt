​Govt sets target of 4.44 million tons for fresh and processed fruit export in 2023
April 17, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was reported on Thailand’s fruit management and export plan for 2023.
Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, and other concerned agencies from both public and private sectors have worked together to come up with a total of 22 proactive measures, covering 4 aspects, namely, production, domestic marketing (Thai fruit consumption campaign), seeking new markets abroad, and negotiation with trade partners to minimize fruit export obstacles. Ministry of Commerce has set the target for export of fresh and processed fruits at 4.44 million tons, an increase of 10% from the previous year. Durian, in particular, is targeted at 100 billion Baht in export value in 2023. Farmers in the Eastern provinces are advised to strictly comply with their province’s harvest schedule, and not to harvest immature durians. The 22 measures will help solve fruit price problem and shortage in quantity, as well as, achieve export targets.
In addition, the Prime Minister was reported on the popularity of “Thai snakehead fish” in Vietnam with its quality and freshness on par with international standard. On March 14, 2023, an MOU was signed between Vietnam’s Quang Binh province and Thailand’s Sakon Nakhon province on business matching of local food, specifically Thai snakehead fish and breeds, between 16 trade partners. Under the MOU, a quota of 100 tons of Thai snakehead fish is granted for export to Vietnam.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister is pleased with an integrative effort of all concerned agencies to add more value and control export standard of fruits, and to seek new export markets.
