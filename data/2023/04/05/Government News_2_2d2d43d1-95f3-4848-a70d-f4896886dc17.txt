April 5, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed about
attendance of the Thai delegation, led by Dr. Pattamawadee Pochanukul, Director of Thailand
Science Research and Innovation (TSRI), at the Commission on Science and Technology for
Development’s (CSTD) twenty-sixth session, which took place on March 27 – 31,2023 in
Geneva, Switzerland.
During the meeting, TSRI Director signed an agreement of cooperation with Director of
Technology and Logistics Division, UNCTAD on “STI Capacity Building Programs on Female
Researchers and Entrepreneurs to promote Bio – Circular – Green Economic (BCG) Model”.
Under the program, TSRI will host a workshop in August 2023 to exchange and share
experiences on the BCG Economic Model with female researchers and entrepreneurs from 15
developing countries. UNCTAD and TSRI will extend an invitation to potential women from
CSTD member countries in Asia and Africa to attend the workshop, for them to learn about best
practices in applying science, technology, and innovation in the development of 4 S-Curve
industries.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, Thailand’s BCG Economic Model has been
globally recognized to promote balanced and sustainable development for an elevation of
people’s quality of life. TSRI’s “STI Capacity Building Programs on Female Researchers and
Entrepreneurs to promote Bio – Circular – Green Economic (BCG) Model” would be a good
opportunity for Thailand to demonstrate capability of Thai women and the country’s gender
equality, as well as to strengthen cooperation with the international community in the areas of
sciences and environment.
