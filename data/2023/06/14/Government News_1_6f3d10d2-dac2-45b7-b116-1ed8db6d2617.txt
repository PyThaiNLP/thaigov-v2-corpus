Thailand commits to join global community in maintaining biodiversity in parallel with sustainable economic development
June 13, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed that the cabinet acknowledged outcome of the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP-15) Part Two and related meetings, which were attended by high-level representatives from 139 Parties to the Convention, including Thailand, with Secretary-General of Office Of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning, as head of the Thai delegation.
The meeting noted with concern over biodiversity degradation acceleration and habitat loss during the past decade, while the Secretary-General of Office Of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning affirmed Thailand’s commitment to join with the global community in working to achieve the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity through conserving, restoring, and capitalizing biodiversity in parallel with sustainable economic development. The Secretary-General emphasized bilateral and multilateral cooperation of all concerned sectors to promote the BCG Economic Model, implementation of innovative financial mechanism, exchange of technologies, and capacity enhancement to stop biodiversity loss and to achieve SDGs by 2030.
At the official-level meeting, several agendas were discussed and agreed upon, i.e., adoption of “Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework” (former Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework), and objectives for an inspirational and motivating 2030 mission as a stepping stone towards the 2050 Vision “Living in harmony with nature”.
On capacity enhancement, establishment of the Global Biodiversity Fund was agreed upon, and Parties to the Convention were encouraged to put in place national financial plans for biodiversity. Marine and coastal biodiversity, including the issues of Invasive Alien Species (IAS) and Living Modified Organisms (LMOs), was also discussed.
