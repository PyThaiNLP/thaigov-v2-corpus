June 21, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha thanked all concerned agencies and sectors, as well as Phuket’s local residents, for putting utmost effort in Thailand’s bidding to host the 2028 Specialized Expo in Phuket or “Expo 2028 Phuket Thailand” under the theme: Future of Life: Living in Harmony, Sharing Prosperity, although the country lost its bid to Belgrade in Serbia at the final presentation and voting session in Paris.
The Prime Minister took the opportunity to congratulate Serbia, and affirmed that Phuket would continue to be developed according to its long-term development plan toward sustainability in various dimensions, i.e., infrastructure, economic structure, and one-stop medical service center.
