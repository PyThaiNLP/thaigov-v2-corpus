​PM acknowledges Thailand’s rank at Tier 2 in United States Department of State’s 2023 TIP Report
June 19, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha acknowledged the United States Department of State’s 2023 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, which ranks Thailand at Tier 2.
According to the report, the Thai government demonstrated overall increasing efforts compared with the previous reporting period on its anti-trafficking capacity. These efforts included increasing the number of trafficking investigations, prosecutions, and convictions; and initiating investigations of 35 allegedly complicit officials in 2022 and sentencing four to terms of imprisonment, as well as identifying more trafficking victims, implementing the new National Referral Mechanism (NRM), and training officials on its use.
The Trafficking in Persons (TIP) represents an updated, global look at the nature and scope of trafficking in persons and the broad range of government actions to confront and eliminate it. The 2023 TIP Report reflects appreciable progress of several countries in combating trafficking, protecting victims, and prosecuting traffickers.
The Government Spokesperson emphasized the Prime Minister’s and Government’s strong commitment to prevent and suppress all forms of human trafficking, including online exploitation. Concerned agencies have been instructed to work in an integrative manner and improve relevant legal and operation frameworks, action, and prosecution in all dimensions in line with the global situation, in a bid to achieve tangible success in combating human trafficking of all forms.
