June 12, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was pleased with the continuous growth of Thai medical device market.
With the current global trend on health awareness, medical device market has steadily been growing. According to the data of Thai Medical Device Technology Industry Association, global medical device market expands at an average of 6.1% each year, and market value is expected to reach US$744 billion by 2027.
Likewise, Thailand’s medical device market is projected to grow at an average of 8.1% per year, with the market value of US$3.38 billion by 2027.
Krungsri Research also reported an average growth of 5-7% per year for domestic medical devices market during 2022-2023 due to constant increase of both domestic and global demand for medical and healthcare devices as a result of:
1) rising incidences of cases of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs); 2) rebound in the number of foreign patients seeking treatment in Thai hospitals in 2022-2023; 3) private hospitals’ plan to increase investment to accommodate demand from Thai and overseas patients; 4) rising domestic and global demand for preventive treatment; 5) constant demand for medical devices from trade partner countries; 6) direct support in the form of government policies to elevate Thailand as medical hub; and 7) development of innovative and technology-based medical equipment and devices.
