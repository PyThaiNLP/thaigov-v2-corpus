​PM pleased with Thailand’s rank in UN’s 2023 Sustainable Development Report (SDR)
June 25, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was pleased with UN’s Sustainable Development Report 2023, according to which Thailand’s rank is up 1 notch from 44th last year to 43rd, out of 166 countries.
According to the report, Thailand scores 74.7 in the SDG Index, ranking first among the Southeast Asian countries for 5 straight years. This underscores the Government’s accomplishment in driving sustainable development in a tangible manner and integrating SDGs in the national-level development goals through synergizing the 20-Year National Strategy, and the 12th and 13th National Economic and Social Development Plans, which has led to the tangible success in Thailand’s overall score and rank in the SDR throughout these years. The Deputy Government Spokesperson added that the Prime Minister and the Government have placed great importance on sustainable socio-economic development for the better quality of life of the Thai people.
The Sustainable Development Report and SDG Index is a global assessment of progress of 193 UN member states towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and has been compiled by Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) since 2016. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals are: no poverty; zero hunger; good health and well-being; quality education; gender equality; clean water and sanitation; affordable and clean energy; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; reduced inequalities; sustainable cities and communities; responsible consumption and production; climate action; life below water; life on land; peace, justice, and strong institutions; and partnerships for the goals.
