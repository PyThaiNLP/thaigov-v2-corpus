June 20, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government
Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen.
Prayut Chan-o-cha expressed satisfaction over Thailand’s rank in the World Competitiveness
Rankings 2023, announced by International Institute for Management Development (IMD),
which is up 3 notches from 33 rd last year to 30 th out of 64 economies ranked under the report.
Thailand’s ranking result by factors are as follows:
1. Economic performance: at 16 th (up 18 notches from 34 th in 2022)
2. Government efficiency: at 24 th (up 7 notches from 31 st in 2022)
3. Business Efficiency: at 23 rd (up 7 notches from 30 th in 2022)
4. Infrastructure: at 43 rd (up 1 notch from 44 th in 2022)
For an overall performance, Thailand fares better in all factors although three sub-criteria,
namely, education, health and environment, and scientific infrastructure saw a decline. A
significant increase in the economic factor (up 18 notches) may be contributed by an
improvement of its sub-criteria, be it, domestic economy, international trade, international
investment, employment, and prices.
