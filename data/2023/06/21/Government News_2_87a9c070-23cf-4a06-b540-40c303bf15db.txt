Cabinet approves MOU on bilateral dialogue between Thailand
and Kosovo
June 20, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed the cabinet’s
approval of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on bilateral dialogue between Ministry of
Foreign affairs of the Kingdom of Thailand and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Diaspora of the
Republic of Kosovo, which will be signed during the visit to Thailand of Deputy Minister of
Foreign Affairs and Diaspora of the Republic of Kosovo Kreshnik Ahmeti during June 22-24,
2023.
The MOU will be the first concrete mechanism for bilateral dialogue and cooperation between
Ministry of Foreign affairs of the Kingdom of Thailand and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
Diaspora of the Republic of Kosovo, and is aimed at strengthening relations and cooperation
between the two countries, especially in the areas which the two parties agreed upon, i.e.,
political, economic, and consular cooperation, culture, tourism, science and technology, and
regional and international cooperation. Under the MOU, Thailand and Kosovo shall adhere to the
following principles: 1) mutual respect for state sovereignty and sovereign equality; 2) non-
interference in each other&#39;s internal affairs; and 3) assistance in the areas mutually agreed
upon. The two countries shall take turn to host a meeting once every two years or on a date
mutually agreed upon. The MOU is not legally binding and does not create any legal rights or
obligations to the incoming cabinet. Substance of the MOU is neither a treaty under
international law nor a treaty under Section 178 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, Kosovo is Thailand’s potential export
market, as it is a newly-emerged European country that remains dependent on the import of
goods, such as food, livestock, petroleum, chemicals, machineries, ores, textiles, ceramic and
glasses, and electrical devices. In 2022, total trade value between the two countries is recorded
at US$12,868,581, an increase of 57.68% from 2021, with Kosovo’s import of Thai products
worth US$12,654,501. Major products exported to Kosovo include: 1) frozen duck meat, 2)
canned tuna, 3) paper, 4) chilled duck meat, 5) air conditioner parts, 6) air conditioner, 7) silver
jewelries, 8) computer, 9) plant seeds, and 10) synthetic fibers.
