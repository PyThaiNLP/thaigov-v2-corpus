Update of Government’s rail system development projects
January 18, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul updated on the progress of the Government’s rail system development projects, and underscored commitment of the Government, under the leadership of Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha, to develop inclusive and seamless rail connectivity in a bid to ensure easier access of the people across the country.
As for the Mass Rapid Transit plan in Bangkok Metropolitan and vicinity (the total distance of 554 kilometers), 7 Lines have already been in service with the distance of 212 kilometers, that is, Dark Green, Light Green, Blue, Purple, Gold, Dark Red, and Light Red Lines. Four Lines, with the distance of 114 kilometers, are now under construction, two of which are scheduled to begin its service in 2023, that is, the Yellow Line (Lat Phrao – Samrong / Ratchada Intersection – Lat Phrao – Ratchayothin Intersection: 33 kilometers) in April, and the Pink Line (Khae Rai – Min Buri / Sirat – Muangthong Thani: 37.30 kilometers) in July. The Orange Line (Thailand Cultural Centre – Min Buri: 22.5 kilometers) is planned to be in operation in December 2025, and the Airport Rail Link (Phaya Thai - Don Mueang), which is part of the High-Speed Rail Linked 3 Airport project, will be ready for service in 2028.
Other Mass Rapid Transit development projects which have been launched but the construction is yet to be implemented (the total distance of 93 kilometers) are: 1) Orange Line (Thailand Cultural Centre - Bang Khun Non): tender auction is underway for Public-Private Partnership; 2) Dark Red Line (Bang Sue - Hua Lamphong / Rangsit – Thammasat University): under consideration for a joint public and private investment proposal (PPP); 3) Light Red Line (Bang Sue – Hua Mak / Taling Chan – Salaya / Taling Chan – Siriraj): under consideration for a joint public and private investment proposal (PPP); and 4) Purple Line (Tao Poon - Rat Burana): under preparation for tender auction). The rest (8 Lines, with the distance of 134 kilometers) is now under study.
The Government has also planned to develop double-track rail network throughout the nation during the span of 2017-2026 for the total distance of 3,157 kilometers. Phase one (urgent phase) of the double-tracking project includes 7 routes (the distance of 993 kilometers). While the construction of 3 routes is complete, construction of the other 4, routes: Map Kabao - Thanon Chira Junction, Lopburi - Pak Nam Pho, Nakhon Pathom - Hua Hin, and Prachuap Khiri Khan - Chumphon, is now underway and is scheduled to complete and open for service in 2023.
New 2 double-track rail routes, for the distance of 681 kilometers, which have been approved by the cabinet and are now under survey for land expropriation, are: 1) Denchai - Chiang Rai - Chiang Khong (with the distance of 323 kilometers and projected implementation budget of 85,343.96 million Baht); and 2) Ban Phai - Mukdahan - Nakhon Phanom (with the distance of 355 kilometers and projected implementation budget of 66,846.53 million Baht). Phase 2 double tracking projects, to be implemented during 2022-2026, comprises 7 routes for the total distance of 1,483 kilometers. These projects are either awaiting EIA clearance/approval, and will later be submitted to the cabinet for final approval. Additionally, other 12 routes have been planned for the next phases of the double-track rail network development.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, the 1st phase of Bangkok–Nong Khai high-speed railway project, Bangkok - Nakhon Ratchasima section (253 kilometers in distance and 179,412.21 million Baht in budget), is now under construction and is expected to complete in 2026, while project design of the other section, Nakhon Ratchasima – Nong Khai (355 kilometers in distance and 318,137.17 million Baht in budget), is underway.
