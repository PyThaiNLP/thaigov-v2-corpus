​BOI’s new package of investment incentives to take effect for 5 years
January 3, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed that BOI’s new package of incentives, which comprises nine tax and non-tax measures under the new investment promotion strategy (2023-2027), will take effect from January 3, 2023 for the period of 5 years.
Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha expressed confidence that the new package of incentives, which was approved by the BOI late last year, would be able to attract prospective high-caliber investors, who are fundamental to the restructuring of Thailand into innovation, technology, and creativity-driven “new economy”.
In outlining the 9 measures for investment promotion, BOI and concerned agencies took into consideration major global trends that would impact investors’ decision, i.e., different forms of trade war, geopolitical changes, manufacturing resilience, ability of the country to tackle crises (e.g., epidemic crisis) with no impact against business sector, and priority on renewable energy.
The 9 BOI measures have taken effect at the beginning of 2023. Throughout the year, BOI will come up with over 200 onsite and online activities to promote the new package of investment incentives, and to attract inward foreign investment from across the globe.
The 9 measures are: 1) addition of industrial sectors, from 7 to 10 sectors, that are crucial for national development. The newly-added industries to be eligible for investment incentives are, for example, manufacturing of hydrogen vehicles, future food industry, space industry, etc.; 2) additional tax incentives for competitiveness enhancement; 3) retention & expansion of production facilities; 4) relocation of production bases to Thailand; 5) investment stimulus package for economic recovery; 6) promotion of smart & sustainable industry; 7) strengthening of SMEs; 8) investment promotion in target areas (four regional economic corridors: North, Northeast, Central and West, and East); and 9) investment promotion for community and social development.
