Prayut Chan-o-cha thanked UNESCO for approving the inclusion of "Songkran in Thailand, traditional Thai New Year festival" in the tentative list to be considered as Thailand's 4th intangible cultural heritage, after Khon (masked dance drama), Nuad Thai (traditional Thai massage), and Nora (dance drama in southern Thailand), which have been inscribed in 2018, 2019, and 2021 respetively.
