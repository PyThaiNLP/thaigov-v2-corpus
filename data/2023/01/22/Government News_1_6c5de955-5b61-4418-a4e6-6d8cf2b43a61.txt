“MOC Agri Mart” application launched for “farmer to consumer” direct marketing
January 20, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed about the Government’s policy on online business for SMEs entrepreneurs in agricultural sector to promote direct marketing of agricultural produce without middlemen. Ministry of Commerce has now launched an application “MOC Agri Mart” as an option for farmers and consumers to sell and buy agricultural produce (e.g., vegetables, fruits, processed agro products, herbal products, etc.) 24/7. The application “MOC Agri Mart” is a collaboration between Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives under the “Agriculture produces - Commerce markets” scheme to boost export growth and elevate Thai agricultural sector as world’s agricultural produce and food hub.
The application “MOC Agri Mart” also provides information on community products, destinations for agro tourism, and other related information, and promotes direct online pre-order from farmers/producers/entrepreneurs to domestic/overseas consumers through provincial salesman (provincial commerce offices) and national salesman (commercial attaché) respectively, which will effectively help solve oversupply of produce in each season.
Those who are interested may download the application for free (both Android and iOS), or check out the website: www.mocagrimart.com.
