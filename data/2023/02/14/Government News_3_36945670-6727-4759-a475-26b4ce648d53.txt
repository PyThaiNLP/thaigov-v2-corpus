Cabinet approves establishment of Swiss Honorary Consulate in Chonburi
Deputy Government Spokesperson Tipanan Sirichana disclosed that the cabinet, in its meeting on February 14, 2023, has made approval for the Swiss Confederation to open its honorary consulate in Chonburi province, and to appoint honorary consul for the Swiss Confederation consulate in Chonburi. This is as proposed by Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The reason behind this approval is to facilitate Swiss citizens and families who reside in Chonburi and nearby provinces on consular services, and to promote people-to-people relations and Thailand- Swiss Confederation cooperation at the local level. Switzerland has expertise in economic development and innovation which may be able to contribute to the capacity building of local administrative offices.
The cabinet’s approval is also made based on the reciprocity principle, as Thailand has also established a royal embassy in Bern, and 3 other consulates in Basel, Zurich, and Geneva. The Swiss Confederation consulate in Chonburi will make the country’s 3rd consulate in Thailand after the ones in Chiang Mai, and Phuket.
The Swiss Confederation consulate is located at 489/9 Moo 12, Had Jomtien Soi 5, Nong Prue sub-district, Bang Lamung district, Chonburi, with the consular district covering 4 provinces, namely, Chonburi, Rayong, Chanthaburi, and Trat. Mrs. Esther Kaufmann has been appointed as Honorary Consul of the consulate of Swiss Confederation in Chonburi.
