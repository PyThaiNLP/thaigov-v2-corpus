​THAI may be able to exit rehab plan sooner
February 13, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Tipanan Sirichana disclosed that the Government congratulates the implementation of Thai Airways International (THAI)’s rehabilitation plan (in accordance with the cabinet’s resolution on May 19, 2020), which has made approx. 70% progress, while the company’s operation outlook continues to be positive with the approx. income of 90 billion Baht in 2022. In 2023, the company expects the revenue to increase by 40%. With the steadily increasing operation revenue since May 2022, coupling with the rising air transport demand, it is expected that THAI would be able to exit rehabilitation sooner than the end of 2024, as earlier planned, and to resume trading on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in 2025.
Not only that THAI strives to be recovered and make a comeback as Thailand’s national airline, the company also gears toward environment protection through reduction of greenhouse gas. According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, THAI’s steady recovery reflects the vision and leadership of Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha, in time of crisis, to save and recover national aviation industry.
