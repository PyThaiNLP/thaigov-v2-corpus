​PM pleased with ranking of Bangkok on Tripadvisor’s 2023 World’s Best Food Destination
February 12, 2023, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan—cha was pleased to learn that Bangkok is ranked 13th as world’s top food destination under the Best Food Destinations in the World - Tripadvisor Travelers’ Choice Awards (https://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Destinations-cFood-g1).
The ranking is made based on the quantity and quality of traveler reviews submitted to Tripadvisor, the digital travel platform, throughout last year. Bangkok also ranks 2nd among ASEAN cities in this Tripadvisor’s compilation. Here’s Bangkok according to Tripadvisor: “Golden palaces, floating markets, majestic porcelain-laid spires…you've never seen a capital city quite like Bangkok. Visit Pratunam or Siam Square for premium shopping, then unwind in the European-style gardens of Dusit. Thon Buri is home to the awesome Wat Arun temple, and over in Phra Nakhon, you’ll find the Wat Pho temple of the Reclining Buddha. Savor mango sticky rice at a food stall before taking in the gilded splendor of the Grand Palace.”
The Prime Minister was pleased with the ranking, and thanked travelers around the world for their fond memory of Bangkok. The Government strives to enhance value of Thailand’s existing charm and cultural diversity, which include sports, art, and local food, in a bid to promote the country’s soft power.
