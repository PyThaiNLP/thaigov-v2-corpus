​Cabinet approves compensation to fishing trawlers taken out of system
February 21, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed that the cabinet has made approval to a proposal of the Southern Border Provinces Development Strategy Committee to allocate Government’s FY2023 contingency budget for emergency at the total amount of 163.36 million Baht for the compensation given to fisherfolks who took part in the Government’s program to take fishing trawlers out of the system in a bid to curb IUU fishing and to promote sustainable marine resource management in the Southern border provinces. The budget will be used to buy 96 trawlers from local fisherfolks in Pattani province. These fishing trawlers have been approved for compensation, following the history check by a working group, led by Pattani provincial governor, on qualifications of boats and owners, and on the issue of child labor.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, the Government’s program to take fishing trawlers out of the system for sustainable marine resource management in the Southern border provinces will enable Thailand to: 1) manage its fleets and their activities for sustainable use of resources; 2) manage total allowable catch (TAC) for each licensed fishing boat; 3) reduce risk of IUU fishing, and 4) provide financial assistance to fisherfolks who wish to give up fishing to start a new career.
