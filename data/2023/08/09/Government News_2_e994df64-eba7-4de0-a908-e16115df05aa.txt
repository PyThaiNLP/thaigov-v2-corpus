Cabinet approves extension of stay in the Kingdom for migrant workers from Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam
August 8, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed that the cabinet approved in principle 2 draft notifications regarding extension of stay in the Kingdom for migrant workers from Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam after July 31 2023, namely, the draft Notification of Ministry of Interior on Permission for Aliens from Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam to Remain in the Kingdom as a Special Case in Accordance with the Cabinet’s Resolution Dated July 5, 2023 (No. …); and the draft Notification of Ministry of Labor on Permission for Aliens from Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam to Work in the Kingdom as a Special Case in Accordance with the Cabinet’s Resolution Dated July 5, 2023 (No. …).
Upon employers’ submission of the list of migrant workers to the Department of Employment by July 31, 2023, the workers will be allowed to remain in the Kingdom and continue working until September 30, 2023. This extension is aimed to promote legal employment of these migrant workers.
According to the Ministry of Labor, approx. 417,261 migrant workers (as of July 25, 2023) have been filed by their employers to request for their stay in the Kingdom until July 31, 2023 (as approved by the cabinet on July 5, 2023). This means their stay and work would become illegal after July 31, 2023. The 2 notifications are, therefore, proposed to the cabinet to legalize the status of these migrant workers until September 30, 2023, which, by then, the new Government is expected to assume its position.
