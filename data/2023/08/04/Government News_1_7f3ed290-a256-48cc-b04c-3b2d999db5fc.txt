Govt strives to establish online channels for Thai fruit exporters
August 2, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed about the Government’s success in promoting product export under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement framework. Export of Thai products to the RCEP markets has expanded well in the first 5 months of 2023, especially processed agricultural products (e.g., granulated sugar, canned and processed fruits and vegetables); agro products (e.g., fresh/chilled/frozen/dried fruits); and industrial products (e.g., automobiles and parts, and rubber products).
Additionally, during the first 4 months of 2023 (January – April), products exported under RCEP saw a significant increase of 107% (YoY), with the total value of US$422 million. Major markets are South Korea, Japan, China, Vietnam, and Australia, and key export products that have leveraged the highest RCEPprivileges include crude oil, canned and processed fish, sparkling drinks, cassava, spark plug, motorcycle, and fresh durian, among others.
The Deputy Government Spokesperson added that the Government, through Ministry of Commerce’s Department of International Trade Promotion, strives to establish online channels for the Thai entrepreneurs to export fresh/canned/processed fruits by collaborating with such modern trades as Makroclick.com, Big C, and Lotus’s, and other online platforms. Through these online and social media channels, fruit exporters could have access to retail consumers and a possibility to business match with bigger trade partners.
