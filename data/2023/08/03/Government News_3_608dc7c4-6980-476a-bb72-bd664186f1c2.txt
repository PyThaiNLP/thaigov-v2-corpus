Thailand’s ranking result by factors are as follows:

2. Government efficiency: at 24th (up 7 notches from 31st in 2022), contributed by better performances in public finances, institutional framework, and business legislation. However, tax policy and societal framework saw a decline due to a decrease in personal income tax collection
3. Business Efficiency: at 23rd (up 7 notches from 30th in 2022), contributed by an improvement in productivity & efficiency, labor market, finance, attitudes & values, whereas management practices remain stable due to a concern over business operation failure
4. Infrastructure: at 43rd (up 1 notch from 44th in 2022), contributed by better basic infrastructure that serves business demand and the improvement of internet infrastructure. However, performances in scientific infrastructure, health & environment, and education continue to decline due to the shortage of medical and educational personnel
