Cabinet approves additional holiday on July 31 to stimulate tourism
July 25, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed that the
cabinet has approved the proposal made by Office of the Cabinet Secretariat to announce July
31, 2023 as an additional public holiday for 2023. In an event that a government agency is
obligated to provide services to the public, or has appointment or duty on the day, that
cancellation may affect public services, head of the agency may make a decision on the holiday
as deemed appropriate. State enterprises, the Bank of Thailand, and Ministry of Labor are to
consider and make decision on the holiday for state enterprises, financial institutions, and
private sector, respectively, as deemed appropriate and in line with related law. Announcing July
31, 2023 as an additional holiday will make 6-day holidays during July 28 and August 2, 2023,
and a total of 20 holidays in 2023. Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha
also approved cancellation of a weekly cabinet meeting next week. The approval is made with
an aim to promote traveling and tourism.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, in a normal situation, special holidays
would be proposed for approval well in advance, and the latest approval was made up until the
end of June 2023. Special holidays for the latter half of the year were supposed to be approved
by an incoming cabinet. However, since the incoming cabinet has yet to be set up, the special
holiday committee had made a decision to propose to the incumbent cabinet for approval.
