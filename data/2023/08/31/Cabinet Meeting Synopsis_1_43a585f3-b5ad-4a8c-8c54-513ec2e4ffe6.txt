The cabinet acknowledged the draft Ministerial Regulation on Establishment of governmental organization under Ministry of Public Health’s Praboromarajchanok Institute, B.E. …, which was scrutinized by Office of Council of State, and ordered the Cabinet’s Secretariat to pass on the draft Ministerial Regulation to Minister of Public Health for signing.
Gist
The draft Ministerial Regulation on Establishment of governmental organization under Ministry of Public Health’s Praboromarajchanok Institute, B.E. …, prescribes establishment of the Faculty of Medicine of the Praboromarajchanok Institute to produce medical staffs under the Collaborative Project to Increase Production of Rural Doctor (CPIRD).
Title: Royal Decree on Zoning of Entertainment Places in Rayong Province (No. …), B.E. …
The cabinet approved the draft Royal Decree on Zoning of Entertainment Places in Rayong Province (No. …), B.E. …, as proposed by Ministry of Interior.
Gist
The draft Royal Decree prescribes zoning of entertainment places in EEC-U-Tapao Airport and the Eastern Aviation City in Rayong province to ensure orderliness of the local area. Entertainment zone, located in the EEC-U-Tapao Airport and the Eastern Aviation City, will have the approximate area of 2,662 rai.
The approved Royal Decree is in line with the Ministerial Regulation determining opening and closing days and hours of entertainment place (No. 2), B.E. 2566 (2023), which has been announced in the Royal Gazette on August 25, 2023, to allow 24-hour operation of entertainment places located in the Eastern Airport City in order to accommodate travelers and passengers.
Title: Approval of Government’s contingency fund for emergency for child support grant
The cabinet approved the budget under Government’s contingency fund for emergency, for the total amount of 998.442 million Baht, to subsidize the child support grant for fiscal year 2023, as proposed by Ministry of Social Development and Human Security.
Gist
The grant will be provided as basic welfare for 2,254,534 newborn babies in September 2023. The reason behind the proposal is that the number of babies eligible for the child support grant during October 2022 and August 2023 exceeded the estimated number, making the earlier-allocated budget insufficient for the month of September.
The Government’s child support program provides a monthly allowance of 600 Baht to newborn babies from poor families (with the annual income of less than 100,000 Baht/person), with an aim to ensure children quality care, and promote proper early childhood development. The coverage will last until the child reaches 6 years of age.
Title: Sales of EGAT’s land property to PEA
The cabinet approved sales of land owned by Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) to Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). The 14 - 0 – 20-rai land is located with Chonburi High Voltage Electricity Station 2 (partial), under the land title deed number 245978, in Bang Phra Subdistrict, Si Racha District, Chonburi Province. The land is sold at 5,616,966 Baht per rai (for the total land amount of 78,918,372 Baht), plus an operating fee of 20% of the land price (15,783,674 Baht). The total amount PEA has to pay is 94,702,046 Baht. This is as proposed by Ministry of Energy.
