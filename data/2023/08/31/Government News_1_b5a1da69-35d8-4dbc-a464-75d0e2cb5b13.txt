​Cabinet approves contingency budget to subsidize child support grant
August 29, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Rachada Dhanadirek disclosed that the cabinet approved the budget under Government’s contingency fund for emergency, for the total amount of 998.442 million Baht, to subsidize the child support grant for fiscal year 2023, as proposed by Ministry of Social Development and Human Security. The grant will be provided as basic welfare for 2,254,534 newborn babies in September 2023.
The reason behind the proposal is that the number of babies eligible for the child support grant during October 2022 and August 2023 exceeded the estimated number, making the earlier-allocated budget insufficient for the month of September.
The Government’s child support program provides a monthly allowance of 600 Baht to newborn babies from poor families (with the annual income of less than 100,000 Baht/person), with an aim to ensure children quality care, and promote proper early childhood development. The coverage will last until the child reaches 6 years of age.
