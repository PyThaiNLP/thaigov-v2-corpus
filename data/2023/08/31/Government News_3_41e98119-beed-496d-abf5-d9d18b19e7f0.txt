August 31, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Rachada Dhanadirek disclosed that today (August 31, 2023) will be Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha’s last day at the office.
Although the Prime Minister will continue to act as caretaker Prime Minister and perform his duty as usual in accordance with Section 169 of the Constitution until members of the new cabinet take the Oath of Allegiance, out of courtesy, the Prime Minister would like to allow more time for the incoming cabinet members to prepare for their assumption of position at the Government House.
The Deputy Government Spokesperson added that throughout his premiership, the Prime Minister had dedicated himself to performing his duty for the best interest of the country and people with his commitment to solve problems in all areas and bring back peace and reconciliation. The Prime Minister would like to extend his support to the incoming cabinet to work for the benefit of Thailand and its people.
