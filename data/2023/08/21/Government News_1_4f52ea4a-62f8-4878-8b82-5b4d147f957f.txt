​Investors warned of 11 scammed mobile applications
August 21, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Rachada Dhanadirek disclosed about the warning of the Royal Thai Police’s Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau (CCIB) regarding digital asset trading and investment scams to which a lot of people have fallen prey. Scammers may fake their profile or post online ads to convince victims to invest in digital assets and assure them of high-profit returns. Some even came up with an application name, which is almost similar with real mobile investment applications, and set up fake trading boards on their fake applications.
The Deputy Government Spokesperson emphasized CCIB’s warning of investment in the following 11 applications: • BChGlobal • OrangeX • NAGA • Cobo • SpotGlobal • Bitmox • Bitgo • BitcoinEX • EthMiner • Paxful • MATH. Those who are suspicious of being scammed are encouraged to immediately notify CCIB’s Hotline 1441. Digital asset investment scams can also be reported online at: www.thaipoliceonline.com.
The Government strives to raise public awareness on all emerging types of cyber threats and scams. However, scammers never cease to develop new schemes. The public is, therefore, urged to exercise caution and carefully learn about such investments before making any decision. The Online Fraud and Complaint Center (1212) offers consultation on problems concerning illegal websites, online trading, cyber threats and accepts reports of problems or other inquiries. 1212 can be contacted by the following four main channels 24 hours/day.
