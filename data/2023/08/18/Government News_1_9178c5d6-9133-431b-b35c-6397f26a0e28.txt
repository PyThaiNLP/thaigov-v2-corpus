August 17, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Rachada Dhanadirek disclosed that the Government will be organizing the “Thai Trade Exhibition Saudi Arabia 2023” at Riyadh International Convention & Exhibition Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during August 27-30, 2023, with an aim to increase marketing channels for potential Thai products in the country and the Middle Eastern region.
The Royal Thai Embassy in Riyadh, in collaboration with Saudi General Authority of Foreign Trade, will organize the “Thai Trade Exhibition Saudi Arabia 2023”, the first of its kind, following the official visit of Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha and the delegation of Thai public and private sectors to Saudi Arabia in 2022, which has later led to the normalization of diplomatic relations and an increasing cooperation between the two countries in all dimensions, especially economic, trade and investment cooperation.
The Thai Trade Exhibition Saudi Arabia 2023 features over 100 Thai manufacturers, exporters, wholesalers, SMEs, Entrepreneurs, and OTOP groups in food and beverages, fashion, health and beauty, jewelries and accessories, medical and hospital services, and tourism and spa businesses. Over 20,000 wholesaler, retailers, and SMEs from Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries with high-purchasing power are expected to attend the event.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, normalization of diplomatic relations between Thailand and Saudi Arabia is mutually beneficial for both countries, especially in economic, and trade and investment dimensions. The Thai Trade Exhibition Saudi Arabia 2023 would be a good opportunity for Thai entrepreneurs to profit from selling products/services, and expand their business network in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East.
