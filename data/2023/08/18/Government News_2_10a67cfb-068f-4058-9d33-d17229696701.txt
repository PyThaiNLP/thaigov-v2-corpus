​Govt aims to place Thailand in top 5 destinations for Muslim tourists by 2027
August 18, 2023, Deputy Government Spokesperson Rachada Dhanadirek disclosed that the Government, through the Department of Tourism, Ministry of Tourism and Sports, has placed importance on the Muslim travel segment and market. Trainings on Muslim tourists' behavior and characteristics, as well as how to design tourism products and services to fit the needs of Muslim tourists, have been organized for tourism service business operators, concerned public agencies, and others who are interested. Training participants will also learn about the Government’s 5-year strategic plan on capacity development for promotion of Muslim travel market (2023-2027), which consists of 5 strategies, namely, 1) standardizing tourism operation for Muslim travel segment; 2) developing tourism products, services, and activities to accommodate Muslim tourists; 3) promoting use of technology to facilitate Muslim tourists; 4) integrating cooperation between concerned agencies; and 5) increasing market opportunities and building awareness among Muslim tourists on Thailand's readiness to receive them.
The strategic plan is part of the Government’s strategy to promote economic development and sustainable competitiveness. Thailand has become a major destination for Muslim tourists across the globe. In 2022, over 3 million Muslim tourists visited the country, most of whom were travelers with high-purchasing power. According to the survey of MasterCard-CrescentRating Global Muslim Travel Index 2022 (https://www.crescentrating.com/reports/global-muslim-travel-index-2022.html), Thailand ranks 3rd as popular non-Muslim countries/states/territories among Muslim tourists, only preceded by Singapore and Taiwan.
The Deputy Government Spokesperson added that the Government hopes that the 5-year strategic plan will continue to be endorsed by the incoming Government in a bid to place Thailand in top 5 destinations for Muslim tourists by 2027, as targeted.
