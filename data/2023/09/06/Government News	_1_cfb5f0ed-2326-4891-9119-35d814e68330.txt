PM calls on cabinet members to ensure transparency and work hard to alleviate people’s plight
September 6, 2023, at 09.00hrs, at the Command Building I, Government House, prior to the special session of the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Srettha Thavisin disclosed about the cabinet’s collective approach to state administration. As the Government of all the Thai people, his cabinet committed to work for the interest of the people, strictly comply with the Constitution and laws, and to address problems related to economic and social issues, disparity, and difference of opinions.
The Prime Minister briefed members of the cabinet to take immediate action in tackling problems. Issues that are not against statutory provisions must be undertaken first to attain tangible accomplishments and alleviate people’s plight. He also emphasized transparency, especially in transferring officials, as government officials who have been working hard all their lives would also expect fair promotion and career advancement. Culture of kickbacks is intolerable. Members of the cabinet were also assigned to look into the state budget planning to ensure that it is in line with the Government’s policy statements to be delivered at the Parliament.
The Prime Minister also emphasized the importance of solidarity, as this is not a partisan Government, but one that works for the interest of the people.
