The Prime Minister stated that Thailand remains a favorite destination among migrant workers. With current labor scarcity and the need for labor import, the Government committed to take good care of migrant workers, protect human rights, and ensure their well-being, dignity, and safety. Comment and suggestion on one stop service management for migrant workers will be taken into consideration for further improvement.
The Government’s short-term policy on generating revenues from tourism is expected to contribute to service sector’s growth and revenue increase. As a consequence, wages would also be adjusted according to the demand. The Government has also a policy to increase minimum wage. Trilateral meetings between labors, employers, and the Government will be held to reach common agreement. The aim is to adjust the starting wage to 400 Baht the soonest possible.
