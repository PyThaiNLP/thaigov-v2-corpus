PM instructs concerned agencies to ensure tourist safety during festive season
December 22, 2023, Government Spokesperson Chai Wacharonke disclosed that Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Srettha Thavisin has instructed all concerned agencies to work in an integrative manner in beefing up security and facilitating both Thai and foreign tourists during the festive season, following the latest estimation of Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) that year-end celebrations and activities would generate more than 54 billion Baht in revenue.
Thailand will see a continued increase of both domestic and foreign tourists during the year-end holiday, with TAT’s projection of 3,755,000 domestic tourists/visits, an increase of 10% from last year – generating an estimated revenue of 12.7 billion Baht (up 11%), and 1,180,000 incoming tourists during December 22, 2023 and January 1, 2024 (11 days), up 56% - generating an estimated revenue of 41.7 billion Baht (an increase of over 60% from last year). TAT also estimates approx. 3.4-3.5 million Chinese tourists in 2023, and has set the target of 8.2 million tourists from China for the year 2024.
According to the Government Spokesperson, concerned government agencies have prepared to facilitate the incoming tourists through proactive public relations on the country’s beauty and safety measures, as well as elevated standard of tourist operators. This is in order to convince foreign tourists and boost confidence on their safety in visiting Thailand.
The Prime Minister has placed great importance on promoting tourism as effective mechanism in driving forward national economy. He also thanked all concerned agencies for continued promoting positive image of the country through ensuring safety of tourists, and called on everyone to be good hosts in order to impress and attract more tourists to visit Thailand.
