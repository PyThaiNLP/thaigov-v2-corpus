December 4, 2023, at 1230hrs, at Natthaphong Grand Hotel, Nong Bua Lamphu province, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Srettha Thavisin disclosed about the resolutions of the 1st cabinet retreat, held in the Upper Northeastern Provincial Cluster 1 (Nong Bua Lamphu, Bueng Kan, Loei, Nong Khai, and Udon Thani), that provincial governors have proposed resolutions and KPIs to a number of problems, e.g., poverty, agro product prices, productive land tenure certification, narcotics, etc.
On tourism, provinces in the Upper Northeastern Provincial Cluster 1 are considered secondary cities, and the Prime Minister has instructed Minister of Tourism and Sports, and governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand to look into their tourism potentials, and capacity enhancement in a bid to bolster tourism of these provinces.
The Prime Minister added that the cabinet has made approval to the construction of 92 weirs in Nong Bua Lamphu to tackle flood and drought, and ordered the Department of Fishery to release diverse species of aquatic animals into the weirs. He said one of the reasons the province has yet to prosper is that it lacks good transport infrastructure. The cabinet, therefore, approved new road construction projects to link Nong Bua Lamphu with other provinces.
With regard to the Government’s support on OTOP marketing channels, Minister of Transport Suriya Juangroongruangkit assigned Bangsue Central Station as “OTOP Department Store” where proper sales outlets will be developed, whereas Ministry of Digital Economy and Society and Ministry of Commerce will work together in developing an online platform to promote access to three province’s OTOP.
