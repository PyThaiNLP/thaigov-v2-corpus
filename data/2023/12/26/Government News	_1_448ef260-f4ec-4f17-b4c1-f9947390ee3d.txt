​PM to make urgent trip to Narathiwat to monitor flood situation
December 26, 2023, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Srettha Thavisin will take an urgent trip to Narathiwat province today, following the weekly cabinet meeting, to monitor the flood situation in the province. Out of great concern for the affected people as the situation has worsened, the Prime Minister will also follow up on the preparedness of relevant agencies on water management, and drainage system, and learn firsthand about local people’s plights in a bid to provide prompt and timely relief.
In his short-noticed visit, the Prime Minister does not want any proper welcoming ceremony which may burden local agencies and officials. He wants them to focus on providing immediate assistance to the affected victims and tackle the ongoing flood situation.
