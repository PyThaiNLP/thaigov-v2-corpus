PM: Issues regarding Digital Wallet Scheme to be cleared after committee meeting on April 10
April 2, 2024 at 1100hrs, at the Command Building I, Government House, following the weekly cabinet meeting, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Srettha Thavisin disclosed that the cabinet has yet to discuss about a revision to the draft FY2025 Budget Expenditure to accommodate the digital wallet scheme. In order to avoid public confusion on the matter, he would rather talk about it after the digital wallet committee meeting on April 10, of which the resolution will later be put forward to the cabinet for its approval.
According to the Prime Minister, the issue of casino legalization was not discussed at the cabinet meeting as well.
