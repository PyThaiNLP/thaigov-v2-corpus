Govt to look into possibility of adjusting official titles and
positions to reflect gender equality and diversity
February 20, 2024, at 1200hrs, at the Command Building I, Government House, following the
weekly cabinet meeting, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Srettha Thavisin disclosed that
he has instructed concerned agencies to look into the possibility of using the more proper titles
and positions to promote gender equality and diversity, prevent devaluing of gender and
economic status, and recognize dignity of people of all groups.
With the diversity in Thai society, the Prime Minister does not want to see people addressing
others with demeaning terms. The Government whip and Ministry of Social Development and
Human Security are assigned to discuss and scrutinize the draft Gender Recognition Act to be
proposed to the cabinet, and, later, to the Parliament.
