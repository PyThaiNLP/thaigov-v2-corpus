PM back to office after being recovered from influenza A
February 2, 2024, at 0900hrs, at the Government House, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Srettha Thavisin is back at the office after a few days of sick leave. He stated that the contagious period is now over.
The Prime Minister also affirmed that he was fit enough to perform his duties throughout the day today, and pay an official visit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka tomorrow (February 3, 2024).
He added that his most concerned issue now is the PM 2.5 particulates which is attributed to the smog from Cambodia, and would make a call to Prime Minister Hun Manet to discuss the matter. According to the Prime Minister, there is very few hotspots in Thailand, but the map shows the dense area of hotspots in Cambodia with the wind moving westward. He has also instructed the Commissioner General of the Royal Thai Police (RTP) to beef up security measure and ensure that the immigration system is up and running to accommodate an increasing number of tourists entering into the country during the Chinese New Year holidays next week.
