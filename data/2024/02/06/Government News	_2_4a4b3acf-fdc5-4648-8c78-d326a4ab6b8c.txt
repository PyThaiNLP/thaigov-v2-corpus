PM orders preparation for drought season
February 5, 2024, Government Spokesperson Chai Wacharonke disclosed that Prime Minister
and Minister of Finance Srettha Thavisin has had great concern over the impact of drought
against the country’s agricultural sector and water consumption, and has instructed the Royal
Irrigation Department to regularly report on water situation for the upcoming drought season.
According to the latest report, the country’s water situation is currently intact. There is yet any
drought disaster. Off-season rice farming in most areas is also in line with what has been
planned, except the area in Chao Phraya River basin where off-season rice farming exceeds the
plan by approximately 2 million rai. The Royal Irrigation Department assesses that the current
amount of water will be sufficient for use throughout the dry season up until the beginning of
the rainy season of 2024.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister instructed Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, through
Royal Irrigation Department, to seek cooperation from rice farmers to no longer cultivate rice
during the off season, to avoid shortage of water for agricultural use. Other concerned agencies
are also ordered to prepare necessary machineries, such as water pumps, and water trucks, to
assist the people in case of drought during the drought season.
