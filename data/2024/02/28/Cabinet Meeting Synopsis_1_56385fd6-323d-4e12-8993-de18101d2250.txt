Based on the report, manufacturing production index (MPI) for December 2023 contracted by 6.3% YoY due to an increase of household debts and high interest rates which have resulted in reduction of domestic consumption of semi-durable and durable goods, such as automobiles, concrete products, cement, etc. Economic recession of key trade partners (i.e., USA, Japan, EU, CLMV) also resulted in export reduction of electronics parts and circuits and air conditioners.
Key industries that caused the contraction were automobiles (-20.59%), electronics parts and circuit (-12.61%), and sugar (-22.93%), whereas key industries that expanded well in December 2023 (YoY) were petroleum refinery products (+7.22%), electrical cords and other cables (+43.29%), and paper (+20.28%).
