​PM emphasizes the need to ensure safety of officers in their fights against drugs
July 15, 2024, at 1130hrs, at Thai Khu Fah Building, Government House, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin disclosed about his meeting with Pol.Lt.Gen. Samran Nualma, Assistant Commissioner General of the Royal Thai Police, to discuss about the anti-narcotics operation, following the recent drug raid in Chiang Mai which cost life of a police officer and injured another.
As the Government has a policy to step up the fight against illicit drugs, the Prime Minister emphasized the need to beef up measures to ensure safety of the officers, especially to provide them with necessary equipment, e.g., night vision goggles and 4-wheel vehicles, in a bid to boost their morale. New technologies need to be adopted as well to keep up with advanced technologies used by drug dealers. The Prime Minister affirmed the Government’s financial support on the fight against illicit drugs, and stated that the Royal Thai Police is assigned to give a press briefing later on drugs prevention and suppression.
