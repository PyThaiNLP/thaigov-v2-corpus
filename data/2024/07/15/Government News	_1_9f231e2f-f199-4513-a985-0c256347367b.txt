​PM: Govt strives to push ahead anti-narcotics in all dimensions
July 11, 2024, at 1140hrs, at the Parliament, Bangkok, during the 4th Session of the 26th House of Representatives, the 2nd Year (First Annual Ordinary Session), Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin reaffirmed the Government’s priority on anti-narcotics, and stressed that economic stimulation must be done in parallel with anti-narcotics operation. This issue has been one of the Prime Minister’s agendas in most of his field visits.
The Government strives to take action on anti-narcotics in all dimensions. On July 10, the Prime Minister visited the Border Patrol Police Headquarters whose duty is to protect the border area. It works together with the National Security Council to suppress and prevent smuggling of illicit drugs into the country. In a bid to promote public awareness, the Prime Minister wanted more publicity on anti-narcotics operations, especially the news about injuries of officers as a result of the operations. He also requested Office of The Narcotics Control Board to consider increasing the reparation rate for officers injured during the anti-narcotics operations from 10,000 Baht to 50,000 Baht.
The Prime Minister added that he had also chaired a special meeting of the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC) on July 3 with concerned agencies. Personally, he is of the view that ISOC remains a crucial body to provide assistance to the public in many ways, be it, helping and rescuing flood victims, providing military-owned land for people’s productive land tenure, and protecting border security through close collaboration with administrative authorities and the Royal Thai Police, as well as suppressing and preventing smuggling of illicit drugs along the border area.
