In his official visit to the country, the Egyptian Grand Imam of al-Azhar will have a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister on July 8, 2024 at the Government House, and meet with the Sheikhul Islam of Thailand, and the House Speaker. His visit is in line with the 70th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between the two countries this year.
