​PM affirms Govt’s prioritization on addressing informal debt
July 11, 2024, at 1140hrs, at the Parliament, Bangkok, during the 4th Session of the 26th House of Representatives, the 2nd Year (First Annual Ordinary Session), Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin responded on the issue of informal debt that it is another economic challenge that is prioritized by the Government. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Anutin Charnvirakul and chief adviser to the Prime Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong have been working relentlessly to tackle the problem. According to the Prime Minister, informal debt is not only an economic but also a social issue of concern. With the ridiculously high interests, no matter how much people work, it is not enough to pay off their debts. These people may end up losing will to work and turn to illicit drugs or crimes.
