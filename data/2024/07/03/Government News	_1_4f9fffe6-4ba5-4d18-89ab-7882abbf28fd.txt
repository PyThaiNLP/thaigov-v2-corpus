PM agrees to consider revision of regulation on prohibition of alcohol sales during 2pm-5pm
July 2, 2024, at 1116hrs, at Nakhon Ratchasima Rajabhat University, Nakhon Ratchasima province, following the 4/2024 cabinet retreat, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin disclosed about the Restaurant Business Association’s appeal to him requesting the Government to implement immediate economic measures to prevent more restaurant owners from closing down their business due to the hike of raw material and energy cost by over 50%.
The Prime Minister stated that the Government looks at the matter from a bigger picture. While business operation cost gets higher, tourism activities have been actively promoted to ensure that restaurant owners gain more revenues.
The Prime Minister also agreed to take into consideration the Association’s another appeal to revise outdated laws, i.e., prohibition on the sale of alcoholic beverages in restaurants between 14:00 and 17:00, a regulation put in place since 1972.
