​Thailand ranks 6th as best destinations for expats in 2024
July 5, 2024, Government Spokesperson Chai Wacharonke disclosed about an increasing number of expats in Thailand. This is in line with the report of CNBC on the survey conducted by InterNations’ Expat Insider which reveals Thailand sitting in the top 10 (6th in ranking) of the best destinations for expats in 2024 (https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/04/the-no-1-country-for-expats-to-live-and-work-abroad.html and https://www.internations.org/expat-insider/2024/best-and-worst-places-for-expats-40450#ranking).
InterNations surveyed more than 12,500 people in February about how satisfied they feel with their lives in a foreign country, and ranked 53 global countries across five indices: quality of life, ease of settling in, working abroad, personal finance and an “expat essentials” index, which covers housing, administration, language and digital life. Accordingly, top 10 best destinations for expats in 2024 are: 1) Panama; 2) Mexico; 3) Indonesia; 4) Spain; 5) Colombia; 6) Thailand; 7) Brazil; 8) Vietnam; 9) Philippines; and 10) United Arab Emirates.
According to the Government Spokesperson, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has continued to promote tourism as one of the Government’s first priorities to immediately stimulate economy, increase revenue, and create jobs. The Government also aims to attract foreign talents. Concerned agencies have been instructed to work proactively in facilitating longer stay of these expats through improving visa application process, exempting visa fees for tourists in target countries (Visa Free), implementing LTR Visa measure, and introducing Fast Track VISA for MICE participants to elevate Thailand as the region’s MICE destination.
The Prime Minister has also closely followed up on tourism trends, and strives to leverage the “Work From Anywhere” trend in promoting Thailand as potential destination for remote work. At the same time, manpower and infrastructure development has been pushed forward to support target S-Curve industries and attract more inward foreign investments.
