PM orders integrated effort of all concerned agencies in preventing PM2.5 particulates
December 3, 2024, at 1210hrs, at the Command Building I, Government House, following the weekly cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra disclosed that she has instructed all concerned agencies under the supervision of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Economy and Society Prasert Jantararuangtong to work together with Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Industry, and the Royal Thai Police in accelerating the implementation of measures to prevent air pollution caused by agricultural burning, vehicle smoke and exhaust, and dust from the industrial sector.
This is such as a measure to ban purchase of agricultural products (sugarcane and corn) if there is a proof that stubble burning is part of the production.
According to the Prime Minister, the number of hotspots and burning areas in Chiang Mai this year has decreased by 50% comparing to those in 2023. Coupling with effective implementation of such measures as the “Joint Plan of Action – CLEAR Sky Strategy” between Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lao PDR, and Myanmar, it is expected that air pollution in 2025 will be less severe than in 2023.
A number of innovations have also been adopted by the Government to intercept dust and haze. For Bangkok and vicinity, the Governor of Bangkok has been working together with all concerned sectors to prevent PM2.5 particulates.
It is also expected that the number of occurrences of PM2.5 levels that exceed the standard decrease by 20% comparing to the year 2023, signifying a better management of dust and haze this year.
