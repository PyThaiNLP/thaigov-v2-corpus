​Thai agricultural product export grew by 6.49% during Jan-Oct 2024
December 18, 2024, Deputy Government Spokesperson Anukool Pruksanusak disclosed about Thai exports of agricultural products during January and October 2024 (10 months) which grew by 6.49% YoY with the total value of 2,146,745 million baht.
Five products with the highest export value during the period were rice (168,685 million baht, an increase of 39.24%), fresh durian (130,352 million baht, a decrease of 4.57%), natural rubber (95,927 million baht, an increase of 54.33%), processed chicken (87,009 million baht, an increase of 10.75%), and pet food (79,071 million baht, an increase of 35.45%). Top 5 trading partners that imported the most agricultural products from Thailand were China, ASEAN, the United States, Japan, and the European Union.
The overall trend over the past 10 months shows that Thai agricultural products remain competitive in the global market. However, Thailand has to face with various challenges, such as global economic recession, geographic conflict and tension, green and sustainable policies, and the “Make America Great Again” policy, all of which would greatly impact the country’s agricultural production and trade system.
In light of this, the Government, through Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, has revised the country’s trade and export strategies to focus on seeking new trading partners and markets in order to diversify risks; increasing the diversity of raw material sources and imported products without relying too much on any one country; and improving product quality and standard to maintain competitiveness. Thailand is also accelerating the negotiation of several Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to minimize trade barriers and help promote Thai agricultural products in the global market.
