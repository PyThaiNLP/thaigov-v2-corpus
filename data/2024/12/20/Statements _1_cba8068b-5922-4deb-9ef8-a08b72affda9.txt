Remarks by H.E. Ms. Paetongtarn Shinawatra, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand at the Bangkok Post Forum 2024, celebrating the 78th anniversary of the Bangkok Post
on 19 December 2024, Centara Grand at CentralWorld, Bangkok.
Ladies and gentlemen, Distinguished Guests,
It is an honor to join you at Redefined Thailand: The Road to Prosperity, hosted by the Bangkok Post. Today, we gather to explore the path forward for our nation.
For decades, Thailand’s growth relied on industrial strategies focused on mass production and heavy industry. These approaches brought progress, but in a world undergoing rapid change, they are no longer enough. Thailand stands at a crossroads. We must pursue bold, innovative solutions that reflect our unique strengths and set us apart.
Our potential lies not in following the paths of others but in leveraging what makes us truly exceptional—our strategic location, abundant natural resources, and the creativity of our people. By embracing our identity and reimagining our future, we can chart a new course to prosperity and establish Thailand as a leader in an interconnected, dynamic world.
Our first strength is our geographical advantage. Positioned at the heart of Southeast Asia, Thailand has the opportunity to become a hub for logistics, trade and exchange, connecting ASEAN, the Asia-Pacific, and beyond. Through infrastructure initiatives like high-speed rail construction, aviation hub and cold-chained network, we can enhance the movement of goods, people, and ideas across borders.
Thailand can also serve as a bridge between East and West, fostering global partnerships for mutual growth and understanding. In an era of division, we can stand as a beacon of collaboration and shared prosperity.
Second, our natural abundance and cultural richness present unparalleled opportunities. Thailand has long been known as the “Kitchen of the World.” But now, it is time to elevate this legacy even further. With our agricultural resources, culinary expertise, and advanced technologies like precision farming and blockchain for traceability, we can transform traditional farming into modern agriculture that prioritizes quality, sustainability, and innovation.
Similarly, our tourism industry has the potential to evolve. Thailand can become more than a destination for sightseeing—it can be a sanctuary of peace and renewal. With our renowned hospitality and cultural heritage, we are uniquely positioned to offer wellness tourism, from spa therapies to meditation retreats, and become a top destination for digital nomads and retirees.
However, technology must play a central role. Imagine a traveler coming to Thailand for a health check-up. With AI-driven diagnostics and tailored wellness packages, we can create deeply personalized experiences. This approach combines technology and our innate strengths to offer something truly transformative.
Beyond enhancing our existing assets, Thailand must prepare for a tech-driven future. Investments in data centers and digital infrastructure will create jobs, attract global talent, and equip our workforce with skills in fields like AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. This convergence of global expertise and local talent will drive innovation and strengthen our economy.
Turning this vision into reality requires a focused and coordinated effort in four key areas:
1. Legal Reforms: Through initiatives like Ease of doing business, we will modernize regulations to make Thailand a more business-friendly and innovative environment. For instance, over 100 licenses now no longer require lengthy renewal applications, and we are integrating digital systems to streamline processes.
2. Human Capital Development: Our government’s One Family, One Soft Power will empower families to share their cultural and creative talents, enhancing Thailand’s soft power globally. At the same time, we are going to speed up the training in advanced technology including AI, semiconductors and EVs to prepare our workforce for the opportunities of tomorrow, as well as reviving the One District, One Scholarship program (ODOS) that enables more Thai talents to gain exposure from studying aboard.
3. Financial Support for Innovation: We will expand funding for innovation and startups, prioritizing high-impact projects with clear potential for success. By improving fund allocation and increasing research investment, we can turn great ideas into thriving businesses.
4. Global Standards and Certification: To ensure that “Made in Thailand” represents excellence, we will enhance product and service standards. For example, implementing international certifications will help Thai exports, like durians, maintain their premium status in global markets.
Ladies and gentlemen, these strategies represent more than policies— they are a promise. A promise to redefine Thailand’s future by embracing our unique strengths, exploring new opportunities, and harnessing technology for the greater good. Most importantly, it is a promise to create shared prosperity for all—our people, communities, and the wider region.
This is Thailand’s next chapter. We warmly invite our friends and partners to join us on this journey. Together, let us build a future defined by innovation, resilience, and opportunity for all.
Thank you.
