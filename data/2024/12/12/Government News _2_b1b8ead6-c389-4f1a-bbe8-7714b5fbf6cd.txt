Prime Minister Paetongtarn Marks 90 Days in Office with Policies under “2025 Empowering Thais: A Real Possibility” Vision
Bangkok, Thailand – Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra today highlighted her administration’s achievements during its first 90 days in office and unveiled her vision under the campaign “2025 Empowering Thais: A Real Possibility”. Speaking at NBT Channel 11, she outlined both ongoing and new policies to address urgent national challenges and pave the way for long-term development.
In her address to high-ranking officials, including Permanent Secretaries, General Directors, Governors, and Cabinet members, the Prime Minister emphasized the importance of teamwork and collaboration across all sectors. She reaffirmed her administration’s commitment to serving the people, laying the groundwork for Thailand where citizens can thrive with dignity and prosperity.
Prime Minister Paetongtarn highlighted ongoing efforts to address six critical structural challenges. Water management remains a top priority, with solutions being developed to mitigate both flooding and drought. These include enabling public-private collaborations for canal dredging and studying large-scale floodway projects to provide lasting solutions. Addressing air pollution, particularly PM 2.5, is another pressing issue. The government has set clear goals to reduce particulate levels and health impacts annually, with stricter anti-burning laws, international negotiations to curb transboundary haze, and the introduction of the Clean Air Act.
Efforts to combat drug problems are being intensified with more effective enforcement measures. At the same time, the government is working to dismantle monopolies in key sectors, such as agriculture and energy, to reduce costs for consumers. Farmers will be empowered to export their own rice, while legal reforms will lower energy prices. Additionally, the formalization of the informal economic sector will generate significant state revenue, improve public safety, and ensure proper regulation. The government is also advancing Thailand’s position as a regional AI hub, supported by over one trillion baht in foreign investments for data centers and other technological and future-oriented infrastructure.
In addition to these structural reforms, the government is preparing to launch new and revitalized initiatives in 2025 aimed at directly improving the quality of life for all citizens. Among these is the revival of the “One District, One Scholarship” (ODOS) program, funded by lottery revenues, to expand educational opportunities for underprivileged students. The government will also introduce the “1 District, 1 Summer Camp” initiative, enabling students to participate in short-term overseas language training, while upgrading district schools with technology and enhanced teaching resources to strengthen skills in languages and artificial intelligence.
The SML Program will empower local communities to identify and address their own challenges, supported by funds distributed through village and urban community networks. To support the backbone of the Thai economy, a 5-billion-baht fund will be allocated to revitalize small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Housing initiatives will also take center stage, with the “Homes for Thais” program providing high-quality, affordable condominium units with 99-year leases. Units will start at approximately 4,000 baht per month, offering a path to homeownership for many citizens. In addition, the government will work towards a 20-baht rail mass transit system in the Bangkok Metropolitan area.
The government’s Digital Wallet Scheme will continue to drive economic recovery and digital transformation. In addition, the second phase of cash distribution programs will provide financial relief to four million senior citizens by Lunar New Year, followed by a third phase targeting the general population to sustain economic momentum. Debt relief will also be prioritized, with measures focusing on household, automotive, and housing debt, including a three-year interest moratorium and full debt forgiveness for smaller obligations under 5,000 baht.
Prime Minister Paetongtarn concluded her address by reaffirming the collaborative spirit of her administration. “Politicians and civil servants alike serve the people. Our mission is to empower citizens, reduce centralized power, and build a nation where everyone has the opportunity to prosper with dignity. Together, we will make 2025 a year of progress and hope, setting the stage for a brighter decade ahead.”
