Royal Thai Police launches “Leave Your Home with the Police” program during New Year holidays
25 December 2024, at 0830hrs, Deputy Government Spokesperson Anukul Prueksanusak disclosed that with the Government’s concern over safety of the people and their properties during the 2025 New Year holidays, the Royal Thai Police is instructed to beef up measures to prevent and suppress crimes, and take care of the lives and properties of the people during the festivity period.
In light of this, the Royal Thai Police has implemented the “Leave Your Home with the Police” program from now until January 2, 2024. Under the program, homeowners may ask the police to take care of their home while they were away during the New Year holiday. Request can be made through the following 2 channels:
1. Online application, “ฝากบ้าน 4.0 (OBS)”, which can be download via the App Store or Google Play Store only. Registration requires the following information:
- Applicant’s personal information
- Details, photos, and location of the house
2. Application at the police station
- At the nearby police station
- Presenting applicant's ID card and details, photos, and location of the house
What homeowners need to do before leaving home includes: 1) check and store valuable properties in a safe place; 2) ensure that electricity, incense sticks, candles, and gas are properly turned off/put out; 3) properly close doors and windows; 4) ensure that the installed CCTV cameras are workable; 5) ask the neighbors to help keep an eye on the house; 6) regularly update on "Leave Your Home with the Police" reports; 7) notify the police if you cannot return home in time; and 8) upon returning, immediately notify the police for the inspection of properties.
The Deputy Government Spokesperson wished for people’s safety on their trip. Should an emergency arise, they may contact Hotlines 191 or 1599, 24/7.
