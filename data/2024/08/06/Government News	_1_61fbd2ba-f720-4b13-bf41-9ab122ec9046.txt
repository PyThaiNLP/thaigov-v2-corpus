​PM: Cabinet reshuffle will not be imminent
August 5, 2024, at 1000hrs, at the Royal Irrigation Department, following the meeting on water resource management, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin disclosed about a newspaper report regarding the United Thai Nation Party’s proposal for a cabinet reshuffle to fill a vacant ministerial position within the Party’s quota that he had read in the newspaper this morning, but the matter had not yet reached him. According to the Prime Minister, August will be an eventful month with a number of judicial/constitutional-related cases being deliberated and decided. Therefore, focus should be made on those matters. Proposal of the coalition parties would definitely be taken into consideration, but not this soon.
On the question about the Government’s peace-keeping and safety preparation against an impact of the Constitutional Court’s ruling on whether to dissolve the Move Forward Party, the Prime Minister believed that the security agencies have been prepared and stood ready for what would ever happen.
