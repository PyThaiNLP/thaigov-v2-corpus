​Deputy PM Phumtham: Govt’s effort begins to bear fruit as exports in July 2024 show strong recovery
August 27, 2024, Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, acting Prime Minister, revealed Thailand's exports in July 2024 which have increased 15.2% YoY, with a total value of USD25,720.6 million (938,285 million Baht), marking the highest growth rate in 28 months since March 2022. This is mainly due to an increase in export of agricultural and agro-industrial products (+8.7%).
The Deputy Prime Minister stressed that the expansion of Thailand’s exports is a result of the effort of the Government under former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, which has begun to bear fruit. Another clear sign of public confidence and expectation toward the Government is that the stock market has been on the rise for 7 consecutive days (August 16 – 26, 2024), with an increase of 74.97 notches since the day the House of Representatives voted by majority to approve Ms. Paethongtarn Shinawatra as Prime Minister.
