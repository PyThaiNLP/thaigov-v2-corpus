PM scheduled for joint field visit to Narathiwat’s Sungai Kolok and Rantau Panjang in Malaysia with Malaysian PM
August 2, 2024, Government Spokesperson Chai Wacharonke disclosed that Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin is scheduled to travel to Narathiwat’s Sungai Kolok district and Rantau Panjang town in Kelantan, Malaysia on August 3, 2024. There, he will meet with Malaysian Prime Minister Dato' Sri Anwar bin Ibrahim.
This meeting between the two Prime Ministers will be building upon the momentum of their previous meeting during the field visit to Sadao Border Checkpoint (Sadao district, Songkhla province) and Malaysia's Bukit Kayu Hitam checkpoint in November last year, and the latest bilateral meeting on May 23, 2024 at the Nikkei Forum 29th Future of Asia in Tokyo, Japan.
The aim of this joint field visit between the Prime Ministers of Thailand and Malaysia is to promote peace and development in the Southern border provinces of Thailand and the northern states of Malaysia to improve quality of life of the people on both sides. The two leaders will discuss the ways to increase mutual trade and investment, and promote tourism and connectivity, especially the parallel bridge construction project across the Kolok River in Su-ngai Kolok District.
