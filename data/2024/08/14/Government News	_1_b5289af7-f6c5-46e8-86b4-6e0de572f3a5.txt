PM: No plan for cabinet reshuffles this month
August 13, 2024, at 1130hrs, at the Command Building I, Government House, following the weekly cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin disclosed that there was yet a plan for cabinet reshuffles. There is also no resolution on the cabinet reshuffles at the meeting of the coalition parties on August 12, hosted by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Commerce Phumtham Wechayachai. As the Prime Minister said earlier, although the United Thai Nation Party has submitted a proposal for a cabinet reshuffle to fill a vacant ministerial position within the Party’s quota, this month, the focus should be made on a number of judicial/constitutional-related cases being deliberated and decided.
As to whether the cabinet reshuffles will take place after August ends, the Prime Minister stated that further discussion was needed to ensure that similar issue would not occur.
