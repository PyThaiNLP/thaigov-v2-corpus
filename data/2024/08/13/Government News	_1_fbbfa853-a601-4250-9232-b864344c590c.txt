Govt Spokesperson: Implementation of Digital Wallet scheme will demonstrate Thailand’s potential as global leader in financial innovation
August 8, 2024, Government Spokesperson Chai Wacharonke disclosed about an article from the Financial Times on Thailand may tell us a great deal about the future of money”, a detailed analysis on Thailand’s Digital Wallet scheme. The article is published via https://www.ft.com/content/9194ca11-7788-4a1d-a6cc-cffea18d0c9d?shareType=nongift, and is written by Prof. Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University, senior fellow at Brookings and author of “The Future of Money”. According to the article, the scheme is an intriguing window into the future of money and how central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) might be used in Thailand. The writer listed down a number of the scheme’s advantages: 1) it is well targeted, with the funds channeled to poorer individuals who would benefit more and are likely to spend the money rather than save it; 2) The funds go directly to individuals, reducing the inevitable corruption when money is channeled through public agencies; 3) The funds have to be spent within 6 months which will stimulate consumption and ensure that the funds are used according to the scheme’s objective; and 4) The funds can only be spent at authorized small shops within the local area of a recipient, thereby, spreading income to the locals and promoting community economy.
The writer also pointed out some risks, such as that the scheme may make it easy for digital money to be subverted for social engineering purposes, and that the convenience of digital payments, and the costs and hassles to consumers and businesses of handling paper money and coins, foretell the demise of cash as a means of payment.
The fact that the Government’s Digital Wallet scheme has interested foreign academicians reflects Thailand’s standpoint at the international stage. This will be a good opportunity for the country to demonstrate its potential as a global leader in financial innovation and to be driven toward full-fledged digital economy, in line with Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin’s policy to lay foundation for future digital currency system in a bid to boost national economy. The Government Spokesperson stressed that all the Government’s policy directives are implemented for the best interest of the Thai people.
