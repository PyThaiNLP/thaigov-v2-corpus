Excellencies,
Distinguished guests,
My fellow pride community,
It is with deep honor that I stand before you today
to address a matter close to our hearts, which is Thailand’s remarkable progress in advancing gender equality, and advancing the rights of the LGBTQ+ community.
This progress, made possible by the unwavering support of the Thai people and the Thai Government, has culminated in the historic passage of the marriage equality law.
This is not just a legal victory. It is a profound reflection of our values as a society --- one that embraces differences, celebrates the rich tapestry of human beings, and strives to create a world where love and respect know no bounds.
As we look to the future, the government is dedicated to a long-term plan aimed at promoting gender equity, and building an inclusive society. We will continue to advocate for laws that uplift LGBTQ+ rights, ensuring that Thailand remains a safe destination for the LGBTQ+ community.
Additionally, we are empowering and activating our tourism sector as a vital mechanism to promote this agenda, enhancing Thailand’s image while generating economic growth through the MICE industry, medical tourism, and long-stay destinations for LGBTQ+  families.
Excellencies,
Distinguished guests,
The government reaffirms our commitment to building strategic partnerships, in particular in Asia. By establishing the Asian Pride Alliance as a regional collaboration, Thailand aims to advance the LGBTQ+ agenda, and champion the pride community both at the regional and global levels.
Building upon this foundation, we are excited to announce our aspiration to propose Phuket as the host for the InterPride World Conference in 2025. This proposal represents the strong collaboration of our communities, and is a significant step forward in our “Road to WorldPride Campaign”, aimed at strengthening our Pride communities and connecting with the global Pride network.
Together, let us continue to build a world where inclusivity, respect and the celebration of diversity are the cornerstones of our society.
Thank you.
