The payment, which will be made in cash, will start from September 25, 2024 onwards.
The Prime Minister affirmed that the plan will strictly be implemented according to the law, and that all concerned agencies, i.e., Office of Council of State, the Bank of Thailand, and Office of National Economic and Social Development Council, have approved the plan in principle.
