Govt to expedite remedies for flood-affected victims
September 3, 2024, at 0950hrs, at the Command Building I, Government House, Deputy Prime
Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, acting Prime Minister, disclosed that the cabinet, in its weekly
meeting today, discussed about remedies for flood-affected victims. He would order Northern
provincial governors and heads of all concerned agencies to expedite exploring damages,
especially houses and public buildings, as flood water has all passed by the Northern region.
Relief and rehabilitation will also be expedited. Whichever action is ready will be executed first
using the central budget for contingency.
The Deputy Prime Minister added that the Government, through concerned agencies, would
look into the issue of utility fee adjustment in detail before making any decision.
