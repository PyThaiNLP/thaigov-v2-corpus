PM commits to bring back bright future to Thailand
PM commits to bring back bright future to Thailand
September 7, 2024, at 11.50 hrs, at the Inner Santi Maitri Building, Government House, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra responded to the foreign press on Thailand’s current political situation and how the Prime Minister would communicate with the global community on the country’s future and political stability.
The Prime Minister affirmed that she was ready to move forward and bring back the bright future to Thailand. What has happened with former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin was unfortunate, but this cabinet would do its best throughout the rest of the term to translate and implement policy directives into concrete outcomes for the best interest of the Thai people.
