Prime Minister's Press briefing, 7 September 2024
My cabinet and I are fully prepared to work tirelessly for our country. We are representatives of the people from diverse political parties, regions, and generations. But I want to assure you that we will use our diversity as a strength to solve problems in a comprehensive and effective way. I believe that opportunity is something we can create. Today, my Cabinet and I are ready to work towards creating equal opportunities and restoring confidence in Thailand, not starting tomorrow, but from this very moment onward.​​​
Thank you.
