I expressed my heartfelt appreciation to Prime Minister Anwar and the Government of Malaysia for the cordial friendship and good neighborliness. I conveyed my intention to work closely with him to continue the momentum and policy laid down between Prime Minister Anwar and former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, and strengthen cooperation in various areas, particularly trade, investment and tourism. Last year, Malaysian ranked number one as Thailand’s trading partner in ASEAN and Malaysian tourists also ranked number one among foreign tourists visiting Thailand. We agreed to pilot the ‘Six Countries, One Destination’ scheme to boost tourism in the region.
We also agreed to work closely together to promote peace and development of the border areas for the benefit of our two countries and peoples. Prime Minister Anwar also extended an invitation for me to pay an official visit to Malaysia at the earliest opportunity.”
