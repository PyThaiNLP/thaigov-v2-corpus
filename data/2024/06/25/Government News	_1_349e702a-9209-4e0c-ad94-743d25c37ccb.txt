​Govt Spokesperson reveals schedule of Bhutanese PM’s official visit to Thailand
June 25, 2024, Government Spokesperson Chai Wacharonke disclosed that H.E. Dasho Tshering Tobgay, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bhutan, and spouse is scheduled to make an official visit to Thailand as the Thai Government’s guests during June 25-28, 2024. This will be the first official visit of Prime Minister Tobgay to Thailand after assuming his second term as the Bhutanese Prime Minister in January 2024, and the first visit of a Bhutanese Prime Minister to the country in 11 years. The fact that this official visit of the Bhutanese Prime Minister coincides with the 35th anniversary of Thailand - Bhutan diplomatic relations will be an important opportunity for the two countries to further strengthen cooperation, and to elevate relations to new heights.
The Bhutanese Prime Minister and spouse is scheduled to pay a visit to the Government House on June 26, 2024 at 1030hrs. He will attend official programs including the official welcoming ceremony, a four-eye meeting with the Thai Prime Minister, and a plenary meeting to discuss cooperation promotion in all areas. The two Prime Ministers will later witness the signing of 2 MOUs between relevant Thai and Bhutanese agencies on tourism cooperation, and academic cooperation, research, and exchange of medical personnel, followed by a joint press conference, and luncheon hosted by the Thai Prime Minister in honor of the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bhutan and spouse at Santi Maitri Building.
According to the Government Spokesperson, Thailand is the first country in Southeast Asia that the Bhutanese Prime Minister pay an official visit, and the 2nd after India. This reflects close friendship between the two countries, and is a good opportunity to forge close cooperation in the areas of shared potential and interest, i.e., trade and investment, tourism, development, public health, education, agriculture, and people-to-people relations.
