PM orders concerned agencies to speed up nomination of Nan province as UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site
June 11, 2024, at 1240hrs, at the Command Building I, Government House, following the weekly cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin disclosed that he has instructed Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and Ministry of Culture to expedite nomination of Nan province as a UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site, and ordered Ministry of Transport to rush in improving the province’s transport system, particularly the expansion of Nannakorn Airport. As Nan and Luang Prabang, the old capital of Laos, are twin cities, and as the latter has been inscribed on the World Heritage List, if Nan is to be awarded World Heritage status, it would boost tourism of the two cities. Tourists who visit Luang Prabang would naturally consider traveling to Nan. It is, therefore, necessary to revamp Nannakorn Airport as an international airport.
