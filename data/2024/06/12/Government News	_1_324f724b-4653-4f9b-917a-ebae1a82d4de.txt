Cabinet approves in principle maximum amount of meths in possession to be considered as drug users
June 11, 2024, at 1240hrs, at the Command Building I, Government House, following the weekly cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin disclosed that the cabinet approved in principle the draft Ministerial Regulation specifying quantity of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances that are presumed to be in possession for consumption (drug users) as proposed by Ministry of Public Health. The draft Ministerial Regulation prescribes the maximum amount of narcotics category 1 that are presumed to be in possession for consumption, that is, the quantity of methamphetamines in possession for use must be no more than 1 unit or 100 milligrams. This is a revision to the previous version of the regulation which specifies possession of up to five meth pills or 500 milligrams for drug users. The cabinet also ordered for the draft Ministerial Regulation to be forwarded to Office of Council of State for its legal scrutiny.
