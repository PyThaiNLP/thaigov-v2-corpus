PM orders concerned agencies to rush in submitting One Map data to National Land Policy Committee
June 11, 2024, at 1240hrs, at the Command Building I, Government House, following the weekly cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin disclosed that he has instructed concerned agencies, especially Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, to submit integrated One Map data to the National Land Policy Committee by 2025.
