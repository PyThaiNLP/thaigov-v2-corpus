​PM orders beefing up of measures against smuggling of illegal palm oil
June 10, 2024, at 1515hrs, at Dome Thong Room, Thai Khu Fah Building, Government House, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin discussed with Police Lieutenant General Jirabhop Bhuridej, commissioner of the Central Investigation Bureau, Vice Admiral Nares Wongtrakul, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Royal Thai Navy (Operations Division), and Director General of the Customs Department Theeraj Athanavanich, about the problem of illegal palm oil smuggling in the Southern region.
Illegal palm oil is found to be smuggled into Southern Thailand from the neighboring country, which has resulted in the price decrease of palm oil produced domestically. The Prime Minister has ordered concerned agencies to beef up preventive measures against the smuggling of illegal palm oil, as well as other illegal goods. Surveillance must be intensified to be able to arrest the culprits.
