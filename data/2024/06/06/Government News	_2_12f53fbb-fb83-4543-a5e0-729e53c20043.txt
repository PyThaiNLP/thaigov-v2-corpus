​PM: Govt continues to address all problems as they are all important
June 4, 2024, at 1120hrs, at the Command Building I, Government House, following the weekly cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin disclosed about the Government’s performances in the past 6 months. While he is satisfied with the implementation of some policies, which will be continuously undertaken, some others need to be reviewed. The Government’s performances include addressing agricultural prices, implementing farmers’ debt moratorium, and tackling illicit drugs which saw four times as many arrests. However, there is much more to be done since drug prices per pill have yet to rise.
The Prime Minister also revealed the matters that he personally attended to, i.e., reduction of bank interest rates to 2.5% to alleviate people’s plights, and crackdown of cybercrimes, as a result of which assets worth over 6 billion Baht have been confiscated. The Government also places importance on gender diversity and advocates for the enactment of marriage equality bill. BOI and Thai trade representative are working hard to attract foreign investments and seek new markets. The Government also strives to develop educational system, promote employment, and address the issue of household debts.
