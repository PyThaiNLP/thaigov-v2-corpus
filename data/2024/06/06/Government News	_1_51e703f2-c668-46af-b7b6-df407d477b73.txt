​Cabinet approves tax measures to promote tourism in secondary cities
June 4, 2024, at 1120hrs, at the Command Building I, Government House, following the weekly cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin disclosed that the cabinet approved tax measures to promote domestic tourism, and approved in principle the draft Royal Decree issued under the Revenue Code regarding tax measures (No. …) B.E. … to offer personal/corporate income tax privileges for traveling and seminar organization in the secondary cities and other cities during the low season (May – November). The cabinet also ordered for the draft Royal Decree to be stipulated by Office of Council of State. This is as proposed by Ministry of Finance.
According to the Prime Minister, the Government has placed great importance on promotion of tourism as engine of growth. He has recently chaired a meeting on tourism promotion in the secondary cities, especially during the low season, and instructed cabinet members, who are also MPs of those cities, to liaise with Ministry of Tourism and Sports and seek the ministry’s support on promotion of local festivals and events in a bid to boost local economy. The tax measures are estimated to result in the Government’s losing approx. 1.5 billion Baht in revenue, but the Prime Minister believes that boosting economy of the secondary cities would generate revenue at the amount equal to at least 1.5 billion Baht.
