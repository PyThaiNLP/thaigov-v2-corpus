June 6, 2024, Government Spokesperson Chai Wacharonke disclosed that Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has placed great importance on tourism promotion as key economic driving force and revenue generator. Capacity building of personnel in tourism industry continues to be pushed ahead as part of the Prime Minister’s IGNITE THAILAND vision, which aims to promote Thailand as the region’s tourism hub and global destination for tourists across the world.
On personnel development, Ministry of Tourism and Sports has collaborated with Ministry of Labor and Tourism Council of Thailand to organize a workshop “IGNITE TOURISM THAILAND: TAT Skill Factory” on June 15-16, 2024 to upskill workforces in tourism industry toward service excellence on par with the international standard. Contents of the workshop include: 1) Service with Thainess; 2) English Skill for Service Business; and 3) Tourism Safety Management. Target groups of the workshop are workers in tourism service businesses, tourism operators, and relevant government and private agencies.
According to the Government Spokesperson, Thailand welcomed 14,760,911 foreign tourists during the first 5 months of 2024 (January 1 - May 31, 2024), generating 701,429 million Baht, an increase of 38% from the same period last year. Top 5 nationals that visited Thailand during the first 5 months were: 1) Chinese (2,911,370), 2) Malaysians (2,012,406), 3) Russians (848,473), 4) Indians (842,580), and 5) South Koreans (803,574). It is expected that the number of tourists throughout the year will accumulate to over 35 million, meeting the target.

He is impressed with the determination and hardworking of all concerned agencies in driving the country to becoming a global tourism hub. Thailand will continue to organize wide-ranging activities to promote tourism throughout this year and the next.
