This visit will be the first visit to Thailand of the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bhutan after assuming his second term in office in January 2024. This reflects the significant progress in the relations between Thailand and Bhutan, especially as this year marks the 35th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two Kingdoms in 1989.
On 26 June 2024 at the Government House, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bhutan will attend official programmes including the official welcome ceremony, a bilateral meeting, the signing of MOUs between relevant Thai and Bhutanese agencies to be witnessed by the leaders of both countries, a joint press conference, and luncheon hosted by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand in honour of the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bhutan and spouse.
According to Government Spokesperson, Thailand and Bhutan have maintained close and cordial relations, based on the special bonds of friendship between the Royal Families of the two Kingdoms, the constant exchanges of visits at various levels as well as Buddhist linkages and cultural affinities.  This visit would also be an opportunity to advance the bilateral relations and cooperation in various dimensions, such as trade and investment, tourism, education, renewable energy, and human resource development. The importance of investment prospects in Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC), Bhutan’s new economic hub, will also be highlighted.
