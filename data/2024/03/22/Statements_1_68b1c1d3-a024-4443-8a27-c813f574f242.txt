Your Eminence the Sheikhul Islam, Your Excellencies Ambassadors of the Muslim Diplomatic Corps in Thailand, Members of the Central Islamic Council of Thailand, Muslim Brothers and Sisters, Distinguished Guests,
I am honoured to attend today’s Iftar dinner marking the holy month of Ramadan of the 1445 Hijrah Year, a sacred time of the year for our Muslim brothers and sisters.
Fasting during the month of Ramadan constitutes an important tenet in Islam, and is a special time for Muslims around the globe, a time to renew their faith and relationship with Allah Almighty.
The occasion of Ramadan is also an opportunity for everyone to commemorate the revelation of the Holy Quran to humanity as a guide for all aspects of life, including spiritual purification, acts of good deeds and forgiveness for one another, ultimately leading to love, unity and a harmonious society.
On behalf of the Royal Thai Government, may I commend our Muslim brothers and sisters for their firm adherence to the teachings of Islam, brimming with abiding faith and obedience to the Almighty.
On the occasion of the Ramadan of the Hijrah Year 1445, May Allah Almighty bless you all with peace and prosperity. May He grant you strength and fortitude and keep you in His providence.
Thank You
