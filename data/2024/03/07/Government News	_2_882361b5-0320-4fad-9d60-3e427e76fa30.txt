PM orders immediate deployment of forces to curb Northern wildfire
March 7, 2024, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Srettha Thavisin has closely followed up on the wildfire situation in the North out of great concern that it widely impacts road and air traffic and the forest area, and worsens air quality, pushing the PM 2.5 particulates to past the threshold into a hazardous zone that affect people’s health.
The Prime Minister has made an immediate order for all concerned civilian and military agencies to deploy their forces in putting out the wildfire and containing the fire lines to curb further spread. The people are also urged to avoid staying outdoor and wear face mask to prevent PM 2.5 particulates, as well as to rush to the doctor should they have problems with their respiratory system. Local public healthcare agencies are already instructed to ensure equal access to the health services.
On March 16, 2024, as soon as he returns from his official visit to Europe as invited by the French and German Governments, the Prime Minister will take a field visit to the North to follow up and get updated on the wildfire situation from concerned agencies.
