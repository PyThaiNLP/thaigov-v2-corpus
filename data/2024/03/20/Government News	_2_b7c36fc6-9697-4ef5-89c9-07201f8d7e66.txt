​PM’s press briefing on outcomes of 2/2024 cabinet retreat in Phayao
March 19, 2024, at 1120hrs, at Phaya Ngam Muang Hall, Phayao University, Phayao province, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Srettha Thavisin gave a press briefing on the outcomes of the 2/2024 cabinet retreat that the cabinet has approved in principle 9 projects of the Upper Northern Provincial Cluster 2 (Chiang Rai, Nan, Phayao, and Phrae) under the budget framework of 155 million Baht, and 4 projects proposed by the private sector under the budget framework of 145 million Baht.
Ministry of Tourism and Sports has been instructed to expedite establishment of Phayao provincial office of tourism and sports by the 4th quarter of this year, and to deliberate announcement of Phayao as a special area for sustainable tourism. Ministry of Transport will also conduct a feasibility study for the construction of Phayao Airport.
The Prime Minister ordered Department of Highway to collaborate with the Department of National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation in processing the request for a waiver of cabinet resolution on roadway expansion at Phayao’s Ban Huak permanent border crossing point, and utilization of the watershed area class 1A for border trade promotion between Thailand and Laos. According to the Prime Minister, this is crucial to the development of Northern economy as the neighboring country has already placed an order for over 100,000 cattle from farmers in Phayao this year.
Additionally, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives will work in an integrative manner with Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Industry, and other concerned agencies to support longan supply chain from upstream to downstream to ensure that quality products are in line with the market demand, food safety is in place, and variety of longan processed products are manufactured, which will subsequently increase longan prices and prevent an oversupply.
As Thailand has continually been affected by field burning in the neighboring countries, the Prime Minister also mentioned an instruction to Ministry of Commerce to set a policy on the reduction and prohibition of maize import which is proved to grow under the process of stubble burning, especially during the high season. The measure must be in accordance with the WTO agreements and the Clean Air Act which is now being deliberated by the Parliament.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Commerce, and other concerned agencies have also been ordered to conduct a feasibility study on promotion of trade and investment between Thailand and the African countries with high population growth, economic potentials and abundance of natural and energy resources, e.g., Nigeria, and Zimbabwe. Following his visit to Phayao TK Park, the Prime Minister also instructed the Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of Interior’s Office of Knowledge Management and Development (Public Organization) to revise related regulations to promote potentials and capacity of youths in a more proper and efficient manner.
