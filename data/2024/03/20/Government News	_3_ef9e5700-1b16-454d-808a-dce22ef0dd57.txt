According to the Prime Minister, at present, Thailand has continuously been affected by field burning in the neighboring countries. The Ministry of Commerce is, therefore, instructed to implement a measure on the reduction and prohibition of maize import which is proved to grow under the process of stubble burning, especially during the high season.
