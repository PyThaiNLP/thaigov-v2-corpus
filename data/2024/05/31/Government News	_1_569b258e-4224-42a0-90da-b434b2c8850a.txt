PM announces vision for IGNITE AGRICULTURE HUB ready to uplift Thailand to the center of agriculture and food in the world.
takes 2 measures to build strength of farmers, Upgrade the production of agricultural goods, and increase farmers’ income 3 times in 4 years.
Today (31 May 2024), at the Santimaitri Building (Outer Wing), Government House of Thailand, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, alongside Captain Thammanat Phromphao, outlined the vision and strategic guidelines to drive IGNITE THAILAND. The initiative, which seeks to ignite collective power and unite the nation's efforts, aspires to elevate Thailand to the forefront of the global agriculture and food sectors. The event was attended by Cabinet members, heads of government agencies, various sector representatives, and the media.
On this occasion, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin announced the vision of "IGNITE Agriculture 2025" to awaken the power of Thai farmers and stakeholders and cultivate world-class excellence. He emphasized that agricultural policy is a significant priority for the government, as the agricultural sector is a crucial foundation for the country's economic and social development. With over 40 percent of the Thai population involved in agriculture, the government is committed to upgrading this sector, promoting Thai farmers, and increasing their income threefold within four years. This commitment encompasses support from upstream production to processing and exporting to the global market, with key policies and measures in place.
Measures to strengthen the agricultural sector start with production factors, including soil, water, fertilizer, and varieties suited to Thailand's climate. The goal is to produce high-quality products that are in demand in the market. Efforts will focus on developing and improving plant varieties and animal species, such as soybeans, rice, cassava, and other crops vital to the country's economic system. Additionally, addressing flood and drought problems will enable farmers to work to their full potential. By aiming for these successes, the agricultural sector will grow, bringing substantial income into the country.
In addition, the government emphasizes the importance of using technology and innovation to promote precision agriculture. This approach not only focuses on the use of agricultural machinery or drones, but also requires precise understanding market trends and producing crops with high potential, such as animal feed crops, cocoa, and coffee. Key measures include effective soil and water management tailored to specific areas, promoting the correct and appropriate use of fertilizers, monitoring weather conditions, and strengthening farmers' financial resilience. To address climate change issues, government will promote development of crop insurance for farmer. Adding value through processing is also crucial. Precision agriculture will enable us to elevate the quality of agricultural products and enhance the potential of Thai farmers.
Next, the government aims to implement sustainability measures, particularly emphasizing the importance of reducing and eliminating agricultural burning. This issue requires awareness and cooperation from all parties, helping farmers adopt alternative practices. Campaigns to reduce burning, which contributes to PM2.5 pollution, have shown some success in Thailand, but more robust efforts are needed. Additional measures are essential to further support the Thai agricultural sector in mitigating the impact of trade protectionist policies related to carbon emissions, ensuring our competitiveness in this critical area.
There are also various other measures that the government values and is ready to implement to drive forward the vision of IGNITE THAILAND. We would like to thank the Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives and all parties involved for their successful integration efforts. These efforts will lead the Thai agricultural sector to become a global center for agriculture and food. We believe that the success of developing the agricultural sector will not only bring global recognition to Thailand but also improve the quality of life for Thai farmers. This will ensure they have a good income, eliminate debt, build resilience, and achieve sustainable independence.
Captain Thammanat Phromphao, Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives, has announced the strategic guidelines for "IGNITE THAILAND, sparking Thai agriculture to become the center of agriculture and food in the world." Thailand is a significant producer of high-quality agricultural products and food, recognized globally. The agricultural sector has the potential to connect with other economic sectors in various dimensions. However, it faces numerous challenges, particularly the low income of farmers compared to other production sectors. The government emphasizes increasing farmers' income through the strategy of “Market-Led Decisions, Supplementary Innovations, Increasing Income." The goal is to triple farmers' incomes within four years by implementing two key measures: 1. Building immunity and sustainability, and 2. Upgrading production of agricultural goods to increase income.
Immunity and sustainability measures focus on strengthening immunity and empowering farmers. Various initiatives will be undertaken, including (1) improving production factors such as varieties, soil, fertilizer, and water. This involves developing plant and animal varieties and promoting the use of gene editing techniques (Gene editing: GEd) and encouraging farmers and policies to be ine line with the potential of different areas (Agri-Map). Additionally, Thailand aims to become the leading and largest seed production hub in ASEAN. The use of fertilizers will be promoted with precision, ensuring the right formula, rate, timing, and method. Efforts will also be made to expand the irrigation area to 40 million rai by 2027 as well as increasing water sources outside the irrigation zones.
(2) Technology initiatives will promote the use of agricultural machinery to address labor shortages, support aging workers, and create income opportunities for farmers. Precision agriculture will be encouraged to increase the efficiency of production factors, reduce costs, and boost both the quantity and quality of production. (3) Measures to create stable and sustainable careers will include reducing burning in agricultural areas, promoting incentives to curb burning under specific conditions, and suspending farmers' debts. Additionally, agricultural insurance measures will utilize modern technology to assess damages effectively, incorporating tools such as satellites, anemometers, and air humidity meters.
Measures to upgrade production of agricultural goods to increase income consist of operations in three groups:
Group 1 focuses on products whose production exceeds domestic demand, such as rice, rubber, oil palm, longan, chicken, and shrimp. The policy aims to balance production volume with demand by controlling production quantities with alternative products, creating added value, developing new markets, and promoting marketing.
Group 2 targets products with high market demand, including animal feed maize, cassava, and durian. Policies focus on increasing domestic production by boosting yield per rai, expanding suitable planting areas, producing high-quality varieties, and improving access to both domestic and international markets.
Group 3 addresses potential products, such as soybeans, coffee, tea, beef cattle, and dairy cattle, with a focus on increasing productivity and replacing imports by supporting good breeds, appropriate innovative technology, and market access.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, in collaboration with government agencies, the private sector, educational institutions, and especially farmers, will drive both measures to transform the Thai agricultural sector into the "Agriculture and Food Hub of the World," while enhancing the quality of life and well-being of Thai farmers. Within four years, the income of people in the agricultural sector will triple. The Ministry will focus on urgent measures to support the agricultural sector, including: 1) water management under the project to commemorate His Majesty the King's 72nd birthday; 2) rice and corn insurance, with the government supporting 60 percent of insurance premiums and the BAAC supporting 40 percent, ensuring compensation for farmers affected by natural disasters; 3) environmentally friendly production by implementing measures to reduce burning through the 4P 3R plan; 4) development of new plant varieties and accelerating the study of genome editing technology (Genome Editing, GEd); 5) transitioning unsuitable crop areas to other market-demanded crops such as soybeans, mung beans, and maize; and 6) promoting the production of products that meet standards such as GAP, EUDR, and RSPO.
