Cabinet approves Thailand’s accession to BRICS
May 28, 2024, Government Spokesperson Chai Wacharonke disclosed that the cabinet, in its meeting today, approved the draft letter indicating Thailand’s intent on becoming a member of BRICS economic bloc, as proposed by Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
According to the Government Spokesperson, BRICS has a policy to expand beyond its current members, and has invited non-member countries to attend the 16th BRICS Summit, to be held in Kazan, the Russian Federation on October 22-24, 2024. This will be an opportunity for Thailand to accelerate its accession to BRICS in a bid to enhance Thailand's role as a leader among developing countries, and increase the country’s opportunity to take part in international economic policy making.
At the 15th BRICS Summit, expansion of the group's membership was approved. Guiding principles, standards, criteria and procedures for BRICS membership expansion have been decided in accordance with the BRICS objective of strengthening cooperation under the three pillars of political and security, economic and financial, and cultural and people-to-people cooperation. Guiding principles also include support for a comprehensive reform of the United Nations, and an increased representation of developing countries in UN Council’s memberships.
Standards and Criteria for BRICS membership expansion are such as having diplomatic and friendly relations with all existing BRICS member states, and accepting BRICS statements and declarations as an expression of the BRICS vision, principles and objectives, among others.
The letter, drafted by Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated that Thailand has placed importance on multilateralism, and the increased representation of developing countries in the international system, which is in line with BRICS principles. Thailand’s accession to BRICS would benefit the country in several dimensions, i.e., elevating the country’s role in the international arena, and increasing its opportunity to take part in international economic policy making and to create a new world order.
