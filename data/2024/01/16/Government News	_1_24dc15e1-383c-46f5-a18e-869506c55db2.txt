PM to attend World Economic Forum Annual Meeting (Davos 2024) during Jan 15-19
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Srettha Thavisin is scheduled to attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting 2024 (Davos 2024), held in Davos, Switzerland during January 15-19, 2024.
The 54th World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting will be convened under the theme: “Rebuilding Trust” with an aim to rebuild trust in the future, in the society, and in the international alliances in response to the current global challenges. The Prime Minister’s attendance at the WEF marks the first time in 12 years for Thailand to be represented at the leader’s level (the last time was during the premiership of Ms. Yingluck Shinawatra), and the first visit to Europe for the Prime Minister since taking office. In attending the event, the Prime Minister will demonstrate Thailand’s readiness to join the global community in advancing world’s important agendas, and to meet with global figures from both the public and private sectors.
The Prime Minister is scheduled to attend 3 meetings as speakers: 1) an opening remark at the Country Strategy Dialogue (CSD) on Thailand; 2) project pitching on “Thailand Landbridge: Connecting ASEAN with the World”; and 3) a session on “Learning from ASEAN” with the leaders of Cambodia and Vietnam.
The Prime Minister is also set to meet with executives of world’s leading firms, Secretary-General of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Mathias Cormann, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum Klaus Schwab, and president of the World Bank Group.
The Prime Minister’s attendance at Davos 2024 will be a great opportunity for him to underscore Thailand’s commitment in building trust, and promoting global cooperation in trade and investment and sustainable economic growth in hope to bring back tangible benefits to Thailand. This includes promotion of energy transition, EVs industry, sustainable food and agro industry, digital economy, and connectivity through the Landbridge project.
