The Prime Minister would like ACD to be recognized as Asia’s platform for international policy discussion, especially among member states, to exchange views for mutual interest with understanding and trust. She also wished that ACD be a catalyst for further engagement to address global challenges and tackle geopolitical competition among major powers.
