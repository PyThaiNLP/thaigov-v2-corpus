PM pleased with outcome of her meetings with Laos leaders
October 8, 2024, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra gave an interview to disclose the success in bilateral discussions with leaders of Lao PDR in the first day of her official overseas visit as leader of ASEAN member state to attend the 44th and 45th ASEAN Summit.
She was very welcomed by Lao PDR and had bilateral meetings with its leaders, namely, Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone, Laos President Thongloun Sisoulith, and President of the National Assembly of the Lao People's Democratic Republic Saysomphone Phomvihane.
At the meetings, Thailand and Lao PDR agreed to work proactively together in tackling 5 following problems: 1) narcotic drugs; 2) call center and online scam; 3) human trafficking; 4) cross-border haze; and 5) water management in the Mekong River. Concerned agencies are assigned to set up working groups to attend to each of the above issues, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs will liaise with Laos counterparts to follow up on related progresses.
