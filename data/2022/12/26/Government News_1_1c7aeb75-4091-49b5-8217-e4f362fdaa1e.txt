​Govt encourages people under “608” group to have booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine before New Year Holiday
December 25, 2022, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed that the Government expects a large number of people to head home during the New Year Holiday while the COVID-19 situation continues to cause an increase in the number of newly-infected cases. In order to prevent and reduce the risk of infection, and to ensure family and friends of their safety, the people, especially those under the 608 group, who last received a dose of COVID-19 vaccine over 4 months ago, are urged to get a booster dose before traveling back home during the long holiday at a nearby public hospital.
The high-risked 608 group, comprising people aged 60 and older, those with 7 underlying conditions and pregnant women, are strongly encouraged to receive a booster dose of vaccine to mitigate severity, if infected. Vaccination will reduce severity and death by almost 100%, especially among the elderly people who plan to celebrate New Year with their younger ones. According to the data collected by Ministry of Public Health, recent COVID-19 fatalities are mostly people under the 608 group (95%) who either never received vaccination or not receiving a booster dose for more than 3 months. Children aged 6 months – 4 years who have never received vaccination are also advised to get vaccinated.
The Deputy Government Spokesperson called on the public to celebrate New Year wisely, and be most aware when having physical contact with the people under the 608 group. They are also urged to continue observing COVID-19 etiquette, especially wearing mask when going out in a large crowd.
