​World Bank reports on Thai economic growth which accelerated to 4.5% in third quarter of 2022
December 18, 2022, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha is pleased with the World Bank’s “Thailand Economic Monitor” report, released in December 2022, which stated that the Thai economy has shown resilience to recent global shocks, and is projected to recover to its pre-pandemic level in 2022 due to the government’s proactive fiscal policy which supports the recovery and mitigate the rising cost-of-living pressures.
According to the report, economic growth accelerated to 4.5% in the third quarter of this year. The Thai economy is projected to expand by 3.4% in 2022 and 3.6% in 2023 fueled by resurgent private consumption and strong tourism inflows. Employment is expected to return to pre-pandemic level and will continue to support consumer spending. Over the medium term, public debt is projected to remain sustainable as the narrowing fiscal deficit and recovering output would contribute to a gradually declining debt to GDP ratio. However, as the global growth slowdown intensifies, commodity prices are expected to ease in the next two years, but they will remain considerably above their average over the past five years and will continue to pose challenges to Thailand’s growth outlook.
The Prime Minister thanked all concerned agencies for their hard work, and instructed them to continue working in an integrative manner during the next phase of economic recovery to ensure efficiency, immunity, and resilience.
