December 27, 2022, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed that the cabinet acknowledged the change of official name of Kazakhstan’s capital from “Nur-Sultan” to “Astana”, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ relevant protocol to change the name of the Royal Thai Embassy in Nur-Sultan to the Royal Thai Embassy in Astana.
On January 28, 2020, the cabinet acknowledged the change of official name of Kazakhstan’s capital from “Astana” to “Nur-Sultan” in honor of the 1st Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, according to which Ministry of Foreign Affairs proceeded with relevant protocol to rename the Royal Thai Embassy in the country. Later in 2022, however, the Kazakhs voted for constitutional changes in a referendum, and the decision has been made to rename the country’s capital back to “Astana”.
