​Cabinet approves action plan and budget for Thailand’s participation in Expo 2025 Osaka Kansai
December 20, 2022, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed that the cabinet has made approval to the action plan and budget for Thailand’s participation in the Expo 2025 Osaka Kansai, as proposed by Ministry of Public Health.
Thailand is scheduled to participate in the Expo 2025 Osaka Kansai, to be held at Yumeshima Island, Osaka, Japan during April 13- October 13, 2025 (6 months) with the theme: "Designing Future Society for Our Lives", with sub-themes of "Saving Lives", "Empowering Lives" and "Connecting Lives". This is a World Expo, held once every 5 years by the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE). Ministry of Public Health will be the main agency in administering the Thai Pavilion, which will be exhibited under theme: “THAILAND Empowering Lives for Greatest Happiness”.
Ministry of Public Health’s Department of Health Service Support has had several meetings with other concerned agencies to come up with Thailand’s exhibition plan and format, and budget to be proposed to the cabinet for approval.
Thailand Pavilion, named “VIMAN THAI”, will be constructed in the zone “Connecting Lives” with 3,500 square meters in the exhibition area. VIMAN THAI will be divided into 5 zones, called “S.M.I.L.E.”, which comprises: 1) S: SIAM (Thailand-related exhibition); 2) M: Medical Hub (Thailand as international medical hub); 3) I: Intelligence toward innovation (food and herb production capacity and technologies); 4) L: Living Lab (workshops and activities); and 5) E: Enhanced and Enjoy our family (showcasing Thailand – Japan relations of over 600 years).
The budget will be allocated from FY2023-2026 budget (4 years) for the total amount of 973.48 million Baht, and will be used for administration and preparation (105.60 million Baht), and exhibition operation (867.88 million Baht).
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, Thailand’s participation in the Expo 2025 Osaka Kansai will be a good opportunity for the country to showcase its image and reputation as international medical hub, strengthen relations and cooperation with other countries, and exchange knowledge and experiences on medical technology and innovation, as well as to expand market for health and medical business operators.
