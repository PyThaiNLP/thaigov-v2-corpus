​Thailand’s effective COVID-19 response to COVID-19 boosts confidence of foreign investors
November 28, 2022, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed about a report of the Board of Investment (BOI) to Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha on post-COVID-19 foreign investment trends that investors have considered more on the resilience of production supply chain and the Government’s crisis management policy to ensure crises would not impact business sector, industrial manufacturing, and export.
According to BOI, during the past 2-3 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, investors, especially large-scale exporters, commended Thailand for its effective administration of the COVID-19 situation and expressed confidence over the Thai Government’s crisis management policy to the extent that they decided to expand their investment in Thailand.
The Prime Minister instructed all agencies to ensure public safety along with promoting export and economic recovery. Investment promotion policy also needs to be adjusted to attract investment during the global geopolitical changes. This has led to the development of new investment promotion strategy (2023-2027) earlier approved by the BOI on October 12, 2022.
With regard to the COVID-19 situation, Ministry of Public Health reported an increasing number of newly-infected cases, but this has already been predicted by the Department of Disease Control, following the relaxation of public health measures. However, the Prime Minister emphasized the need to be prepared and remain on guard. Department of Disease Control is instructed to work together with chief medical officers in industrial-clustered provinces to develop COVID-19 measures and compliance approaches for industrial plants to ensure production continuity.
According to the Department of Disease Control’s report on the COVID-19 situation for the period of November 20-26, 2022, a total of 4,914 new confirmed cases, or an average of 702 cases per day, is recorded, which is an increase from 3,957 (an average of 565 cases per day) recorded in the previous week (November 13-19, 2022). This makes the cumulative number of 2,483,809 cases since January 1, 2022.
The week of November 20-26, 2022 saw the total deaths of 74 persons (an average of 10 persons per day), and 553 active case patients who have developed pneumonia (319 of whom were on ventilators). The death toll since January 1, 2022 is 11,482.
Cumulative number of vaccinations across the country, as of November 26, 2022, is 143,155,910 doses (1st shot: 57,086,730, 2nd shot: 53,570,366, and 3rd shot and more: 32,498,814 doses).
