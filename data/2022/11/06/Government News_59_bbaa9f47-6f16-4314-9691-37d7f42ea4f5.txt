Cabinet approves extension of personal income tax exemption for community enterprises
October 25, 2022, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed that the cabinet, in its meeting today, approved in principle the draft Finance Ministerial Regulation  issued under the Revenue Code Regarding Exemption from Revenue Taxes (No. …), B.E. … The draft Ministerial Regulation prescribes 3-year extension of personal income tax exemption for community enterprises (non-registered ordinary partnership and non-juristic body of persons only) whose annual income does not exceed 1.8 million Baht. This income tax exemption will take effect from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025. The aim is to alleviate tax burden of community enterprises registered with the Department of Agricultural Extension, enabling them to grow and expand into SMEs in the future.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, the Government will not lose any additional revenue from putting in place this tax measure since community enterprises have been exempted of personal income tax since 2008. In 2021, 1,350 community enterprises were benefited from the tax measure. The total of 3.1 million Baht was exempted from the assessable income of 582.3 million Baht.
