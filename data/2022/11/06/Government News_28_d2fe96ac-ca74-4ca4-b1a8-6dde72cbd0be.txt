National revenue reaches 2.2 trillion Baht during first 11 months of FY2022
September 22, 2022, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed about the Government’s revenue during the first 11 months of Fiscal Year 2022 (October 2021- August 2022) which has amounted to 2,256,250 million Baht, an increase of 6.8%yoy. This is 5.5% higher than the forecast of 117,898 million Baht.
Out of the total revenue earned during the first 11 months of FY2022, the Revenue Department has collected 1,867,250  million Baht, an increase of 248,422 million or 15.3%yoy, and 14.6% (238,187 million Baht) higher than estimated. This is thanks to continued economic growth and an expansion of consumption and import value that have contributed to the increase of revenue from VAT and corporate income tax.
On the other hand, the Excise Department yielded 465,823  million Baht during the first 11 months of FY2022, a decrease of 28,730 million Baht (5.8%) yoy, which is 15% (82,253 million Baht) lower than the earlier estimation. This is due to the decrease in tax rate applied on diesel to alleviate people’s plight as a result of global gasoline price hike.
Revenue collected during the first 11 months of FY2022 by the Customs Department accounts for 100,894 million Baht, an increase of 7,309 million Baht (7.8%) yoy, and 9.5 % (8,794 million Baht) higher than an earlier estimation.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the increase of revenue shows an emerging sign of economic recovery. The Government is well aware of the current challenges and strives to implement proper policies for socio-economic development and better livelihood for the Thai people. The revenue increase has signaled that the Government’s policy and measure implementation is on the right track and relevant to the situation. The continued recovery of Thai tourism, following the reopening of the country to foreign visitors, also contributed to the revenue increase.
