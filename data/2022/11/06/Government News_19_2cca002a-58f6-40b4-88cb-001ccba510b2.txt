Border trade and cross-border trade value expected to reach 1.08 trillion Baht at year end
September 14, 2022, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed about Thailand’s border trade and cross-border trade activities that during the first 7 months (January- July) of 2022, border trade and cross-border trade value has amounted to 999,578 million Baht, an increase of 2.98% yoy. This is a positive signal for the country’s economic recovery.
Border trade and cross-border trade value in July 2022 is recorded at 150,286 million Baht, an increase of 1.85% yoy. Supporting factors for the increase are the weakening Baht (which enhances price competitiveness of the Thai products), an increase of global gasoline prices and demand for gasoline of the neighboring countries, and the beginning of the neighboring countries’ economic recovery. In addition, out of 97 border checkpoints, 60 has been reopened after the COVID-19 situation eased. Continuous growth of border trade and cross-border trade activities during the latter half of 2022 is expected, while the total value of 1.08 trillion Baht (an increase of 5%) is estimated for the whole year.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Government has a policy to promote border trade and constructive cooperation among people in the local areas in a bid to boost local economy and address border problems. Concerned public and private agencies have been working together to push forward proactive and in-depth export through organizing activities to promote spendings in the border areas, and relaxing border crossing measures. The Government has also made agreement with the neighboring countries, both Malaysia and Lao PDR, on the development of free zones along the border areas to further bolster border trade activities.
