August 29, 2022, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that the Government acknowledged the report of Japan-based “Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I)”, and is pleased that R&I has affirmed Thailand's sovereign credit rating at 'A-' with a Stable Outlook.
According to Ministry of Finance’s Public Debt management Office, the rating reflects effectiveness of the Government’s financial and fiscal measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, coupling with continuous increase of inward foreign investment in production industry and the growth of tourism sector that support full recovery of the Thai economy. R&I expressed confidence that the Thai Government would be able to maintain fiscal stability and the country’s public debt burden at an appropriate rate in accordance with the State Fiscal and Financial Disciplines Act, B.E. 2561.
Although Thailand has seen a deficit of its current account balance this year due to the decrease in revenue from tourism sector, higher transport costs, semiconductor shortage, and China’s new round of COVID-19 lockdown, R&I forecasted that Thailand’s current account balance will record a surplus in 2023 thanks to the recovery of tourism sector and a decrease of energy prices. The country’s external finance sector has remained strong with large foreign exchange reserves and high liquidity. It is important for the Thai Government to implement proactive measures for the development of value-based industries and the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), and to continue investing in infrastructure projects, as well as promote foreign direct investment which are conducive to long-term economic growth.
According to the acting Government Spokesperson, the Government has carefully undertaken financial and fiscal policies for post-COVID-19 economic rehabilitation, taking into account the benefit of the nation and people, and sustainable growth of the Thai economy.
