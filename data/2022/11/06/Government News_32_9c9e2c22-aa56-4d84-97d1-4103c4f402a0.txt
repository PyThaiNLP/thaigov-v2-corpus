September 27, 2022, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that the cabinet approved the budget framework of 2,100.61 million Baht from the Government’s contingency fund for emergency to pay for the remuneration and compensation to village health volunteers and Bangkok health volunteers for their duties in monitoring, preventing, and controlling the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in respective communities.
Ministry of Public Health’s Department of Health Service Support assessed that the COVID-19 situation has not yet come to an end, and it is, therefore, necessary to continue tasking health volunteers until the end of September 2022 to monitor, prevent, and control the spread of the disease, as well as to prepare communities for the post-pandemic phase.
With the approved budget, 1,039,729 village health volunteers and 10,577 Bangkok health volunteers, altogether 1,050,306 people, will receive 500 Baht/person/month for 4 months (June -September 2022) for a total of 2,000 Baht/person. During the period of October 2021- September 2022, the Government has made approval to the total budget of 6,301.83 million Baht (approx. 6,000 Baht/person) to be paid as remuneration of the health volunteers for their duties in COVID-19 monitoring, prevention, and control.
