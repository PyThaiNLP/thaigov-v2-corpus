October 16, 2022, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has handed down a policy to Ministry of Labor to promote the opportunity of Thai laborers in both domestic and overseas markets, and to enhance their skills according to the market demand.
Top 4 countries where Thai laborers were sent to work in 2021 are Israel, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. Ministry of Labor also plans to expand the labor markets, and enhance skills of Thai laborers in accordance with the demand of overseas markets.
Social Security Office (SSO) has recently accepted applications of Thai workers and working volunteers abroad to become insured persons under section 39 and 40, so that they receive similar social security and benefits as those who are employed domestically. Laborers who are working in other countries and are interested may visit SSO website: www.sso.go.th, or Facebook, or call Ministry of Labor’s Hotline at 1506 for further information.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Government has been working closely with labor offices of several countries to ensure them of the potential and capability of Thai workers and working volunteers, and strives to provide similar protection and benefits to those who work abroad since these laborers are crucial to national development and advancement.
