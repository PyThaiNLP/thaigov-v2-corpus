Ministry of Public Health reported that Thailand is the first country to take part in WHO’s Joint Assessment Mission to Assess Health System Capacity and Essential Public Health Functions to Address the Health Needs of Refugees and Migrants, thanks to its efficient public health system, especially during the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Field trips have been made to target provinces, namely, Bangkok, Samut Sakhon, and Tak, by WHO representatives, experts from Thailand and international organizations, executives of Ministry of Public Health, and representatives of concerned agencies on October 17-21, 2022, to assess Thailand’s public health management and capacity, basic healthcare process, and preparedness of healthcare facilities that provide services to the refugees and migrants.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister has placed importance on efficient management of public health system. Thailand has been recognized among the international community for its effective response to COVID-19 and equal access to treatment and vaccine for both the Thais, foreigners, migrant workers, refugees, and migrants. This is in accordance with the Government’s policy to treat everyone in the Kingdom equally, especially during the pandemic, since migrant workers are also crucial to the Thai economic development. The Prime Minister has confidence in the country’s public health standard and excellence, which is recognized worldwide.
