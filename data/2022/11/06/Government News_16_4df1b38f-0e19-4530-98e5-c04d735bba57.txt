Govt pleased with continuous increase of inward foreign investment
September 12, 2022, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that the Government is pleased with continued confidence of foreign investors on Thailand’s potential as production base.
According to the Government Spokesperson, inward foreign investment continues to grow. During the first half of 2022 (January- June 2022), over 784 projects have been filed for investment promotion, with the combined value of approx. 200 billion Baht. It is also expected that applications for investment promotion throughout this year will reach 500 billion Baht. Businesses that saw the most requests are Government-promoted industries, i.e., EV manufacturing, BCG industries, and other related industries.
The Government has also launched the new type of visa, “Long-Term Resident Visa (LTR Visa)”, on September 1, 2022 to attract wealthy global citizens and pensioners, digital nomads, and highly-skilled professionals. This is in line with the Government’s policy to offer privileges to foreign investors in 12 targeted S-Curve industries to establish their business base in Thailand. The Government Spokesperson emphasized that the Government strives to promote environmental-friendly investment on the basis of balanced and sustainable growth, especially investment in the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Economy, to enhance Thai economic potentials and promote green economy.
