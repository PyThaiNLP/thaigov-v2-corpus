Govt strives to promote global food security under “Thai Kitchen to the World” policy
September 4, 2022, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri revealed Thailand’s success in hosting the 7th APEC Food Security Ministerial Meeting on August 26, 2022 in Hua Hin, Prachuab Kirikhan, where the issue of food security was highlighted, as well as Thailand’s commitment to promote food security in the Asia-Pacific through its “Thai Kitchen to the World” policy.
Thailand and other 21 APEC economies have adopted APEC Food Security Declaration, which demonstrates intent and political commitment of APEC economies to promote food security in the region. Under the Declaration, 4 key policies will be pushed forward, namely, 1) food safety, 2) international trade, 3) environmental-friendly production, and 4) promotion of public and private sector cooperation.
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives also proceeds according to the Food Security Roadmap Towards 2030 through implementation of the 3S policy (Safety, Security, and Sustainability) which covers promotion of food security and standardized and nutritious food, BCG model-driven agro-technology and innovation, and Big Data.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Thai Government is well aware of various problems that may lead to global food security crisis. It, therefore, strives to produce safe and quality food, export food and agro products, and implement the “Thai Kitchen to the World” policy to promote APEC and global food security.
