With regard to the report on newfound variants, BQ.1.1, and XBB in other countries, Department of Medical Sciences affirmed that there was no single case of the new COVID-19 variants found in Thailand, while the variant found mostly in Thailand is BA.5, which is in line with the global COVID-19 situation.
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, although the Government has downgraded COVID-19 to a “communicable disease under surveillance” from October 1 onward, Ministry of Public Health, through Department of Medical Sciences, has continued to closely monitor viral mutation, which has, so far, not been detected. Nevertheless, the Government would like to reiterate the importance of booster shots of the vaccine, especially for the 608 groups of people. From October 12, 2022 onward, the COVID-19 vaccine will also be given to the kids between 6 months and 4 years of age. Approx 400,000 children have registered in advance for the vaccine.
