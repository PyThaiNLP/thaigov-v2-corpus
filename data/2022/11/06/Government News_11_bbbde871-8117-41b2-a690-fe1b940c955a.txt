September 7, 2022, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed about the Government’s commitment to address household debts, incurred as a result of the COVID-19 crisis through the organization of the “SMEs and Household Debt Settlement Mediation” during September 8-11, 2022 at Impact Exhibition Hall 5, Muang Thong Thani.
Government agencies, namely, the Student Loan Fund, and Ministry of Justice’s Legal Executive Department, and Rights and Liberties Protection Department, have collaborated with 22 financial institutions and other 2 public agencies, to organize “SMEs and Household Debt Settlement Mediation”. The aim is to assist default debtors whose contract has been terminated and who are about to enter into litigation, as well as those who are legally enforced. Debtors who enter the debt settlement mediation process will not be legally enforced which will free them from additional financial burden. Other benefits of debt settlement mediation also include extension of debt repayment; penalty reduction / reduction of interests /reduction of monthly installment rate; and no asset confiscation / auction.
“SMEs and Household Debt Settlement Mediation” has been organized at 77 different venues throughout the country in 6 months, and managed to help 210,208 people settle debts of over 38,067 million Baht. This time, 172,855 debtors (with the total debts of 30,651 million Baht) have been encouraged to attend, out of whom 75,025 debtors (total debts of 9,959 million Baht) will take part in pre-litigation mediation, and 97,830 (total debts of 20,692 million Baht) will take part in post-litigation mediation.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Government strives to mitigate people’s plight, and would like to invite entrepreneurs and individuals to the “SMEs and Household Debt Settlement Mediation” to solve the problem together and seek a way out of this crisis for better future.
