At the meeting, Thailand and APEC economies agreed to promote networking for inclusive women empowerment. Environment that is enabling and conducive for women to thrive is essential to advancing inclusive and sustainable economic growth in the region. The meeting also emphasized the need to prevent and eliminate all forms of gender-based violence and discrimination against women and girls, and empowerment and advancement of women and gender equality in the Asia Pacific region towards an open, dynamic, resilient and peaceful Asia-Pacific community by 2040 for the prosperity of all our people and future generations.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Thai Government has placed importance on women’s economic empowerment. As host of APEC 2022, Thailand envisions sustainable and resilient economy and society through adoption of the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Economy model, which integrates and synergizes three economic approaches, where technology and innovation are used to create value, reduce waste, and promote a sustainable business model. Promoting women’s economic empowerment and access to capital and markets, leadership positions in all levels of decision making, and inclusive and quality education, training and skills development would bring about balanced and inclusive socio-economic and environmental growth.
