Thailand to export rice to Iraq for the first time in 7 years
Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-chawas pleased to be reported on the planned export of 44,000 tons of Thai rice to Iraq for the first time in 7 years. The Government stands ready to support exporters to open more markets for Thai rice in addition to the existing markets (premium/general/niche markets). This export activity would boost confidence of Thai rice among the Iraqis, and benefit the Thai farmers.
According to the Government Spokesperson, 44,000 tons of 100% white rice will be dispatched in the middle of August, the first lot to Iraq in 7 years since the country’s suspension of rice import from Thailand. It is expected that Thai rice exporters be able to continue to export rice to Iraq. The Government commits to provide continuous support to increase Thai agricultural product export to other Asian countries, the Middle East, and other continents. The Prime Minister also enjoined Ministry of Commerce to promote Thai rice and other agricultural products in a bid to increase global market share and to replace the slowdown in domestic consumption as a result of the economicand COVID-19 crisis.
