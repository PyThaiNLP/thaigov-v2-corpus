PM closely follows up on implementation of measures against energy price hike
March 23, 2022, government spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha had been well aware of people's plights as a result of the energy price hike. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has impacted cost for production, transport and logistics, resulting in the higher cost of living. In light of this, the Government has implemented additional measures to curb energy price hike and mitigate the plights of over 40 million people under the budget framework of no less than 50 billion Baht. These measures are:
1. 20 million household users of not more than 300 electricity units per month: reduction of FT by 22 satang per unit for 4 months (May - August)
2. 11.2 million employers and employees under Section 33: reduction in the contributions to the social security fund from 5% to 1% during May and July
3. 9 million farmers: to be benefited from the Government’s solutions to feed and fertilizer shortage and price hike
4. 3.6 million state welfare card holders: an increase of monthly subsidy for the purchase of cooking gas from 45 to 100 Baht for 3 months
5. 1.9 million employees under Section 39: reduction in the contributions to the social security fund from 9% to 1.9% during May and July
6. 157,000 motorcycle taxi drivers: the discount of gasohol by 5 Baht/liter for the total of 50 liters for 3 months
7. 1,500 street vendors with state welfare card: the discount of 100 baht per month for the purchase of cooking gas for 3 months
8. Taxi drivers under the PTT’s “Same Breath” campaign: the purchase of LPG for vehicular use at 13.62 baht/kg (10,000 Baht/month) for 3 months
9. Retail price for diesel to be pegged at 30 Baht/liter
10. Retail price for NGV to be pegged at 15.59 Baht/kg
According to the Government Spokesperson, these measures will help mitigate the energy price hike impact. It is expected that Thai economy will continue to grow by no less than 3%. The Prime Minister instructed all concerned agencies to put utmost effort in alleviating people’s cost of living burden, and in solving household debts through implementing both short, medium, and long-term plans. He has constantly insisted that the Government would not leave anyone behind. “Thailand transformation” will be pushed forward to create economic opportunity, new jobs and income for the Thai people.
