PM concerned over wellbeing of Thais in Ukraine
Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has closely followed up on the Ukraine situation, and expressed concern over the wellbeing of Thais in the country.
The Prime Minister was reported that Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concerned agencies have already provided help to Thai citizens in Ukraine to evacuate from the emergency situation/war. At present 47 Thais have taken refuge in the shelter set up in Lviv, and 43 others are on their way to the city. Aside from helping with the evacuation, concerned authority also checked with Thai communities in several Ukrainian cities to find out if they are ok. So far, over a hundred of Thais remain safe and sound in their residence as they are still unable to leave due to either the city lockdown or instability of the situation.
According to the Government Spokesperson, there are 2 evacuation plans. First, on February 27 41 Thais from Odessa were evacuated by a rental bus to the Ukraine-Romania border, and picked up by the Royal Thai Embassy in Romania’s Bucharest to prepare for the repatriation on March 1-2, 2022. The second plan is to evacuate 43 Thais in the Lviv shelter on February 27, and the rest on February 28 to Poland’s capital city, Warsaw. The repatriation from Warsaw will take place on March 1-4, 2022.
The Prime Minister thanked and conveyed his moral support to all the officials concerned who have put an effort to help Thais in Ukraine, and advised them to exercise carefulness and cautiousness in their operation to ensure everyone’s safety.
