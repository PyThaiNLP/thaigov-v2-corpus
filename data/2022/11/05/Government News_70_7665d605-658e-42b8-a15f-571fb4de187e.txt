​Prime Minister pleased with AstraZeneca’s confirmation to deliver 61 million doses by end of this year.
August 23, 2021, at the Government House, Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha had a teleconference with Mr. Pascal Claude Roland Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca on COVID-19 prevention cooperation. From the discussion, AstraZeneca confirms that it will step up vaccine deliveries and will aim to deliver the remaining doses by the end of this year, with which the total number of COVID-19 vaccines of all types would reach 120 million doses, covering more than 60 million people. This exceeds the target set earlier, which is to acquire 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for 50 million people. Both sides are delighted by the good news as the delivery of the vaccines will accelerate herd immunity and the revival of the country's economy.
Mr. Anucha also revealed that The Government has secured the option to switch to AstraZeneca’s new vaccine candidate which is currently under development. The new vaccine candidate is designed to maintain the high levels of protection of the current vaccine, while providing additional protection against new variants. This broadens the Government’s options to protect the people as the virus continues to evolve. The deal should be finalized by September this year.
