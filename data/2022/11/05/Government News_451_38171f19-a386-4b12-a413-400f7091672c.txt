Govt Spokesperson: Govt continues to undertake duty on post-COVID-19 economic recovery without administrative vacuum
August 26, 2022, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri reaffirmed that the ruling of the Constitutional Court to suspend Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha from official duties and Deputy Prime Minister Gen. Prawit Wongsuwon’s assumption of duty as acting Prime Minister would not affect national administration, public official duty performances, nor implementation of various policies. The Government continues to undertake its duty to promote post-COVID-19 economic recovery without any administrative vacuum.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the private sector and business sectors, such as financial and banking and tourism, have confidence and positive reaction over the Government’s stability and acting premiership which is in accordance with the Rule of Law. Public sector investment policy will not be affected either as the budget expenditure for FY2023 has already been passed. He affirmed that the Government would continue to implement policies and plans under the National Strategy framework until the end of its term. Dissidents are urged to end their demonstration and wait for the Constitutional Court’s ruling. All sides should join hands in creating positive and pleasant atmospheres in order to boost confidence of foreign investors and attract tourists for the recovery of our economy.
