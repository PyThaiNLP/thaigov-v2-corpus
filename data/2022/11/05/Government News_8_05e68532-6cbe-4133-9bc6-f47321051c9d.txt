PM hands down policy for setup of ministerial-level anti-fake news centers
June 20, 2021, Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that following Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha’s order for an establishment of ministerial-level anti-fake news centers to counter distorted information and provide prompt explanation of the facts to the public, several ministries have already set up their own anti-fake news center, i.e., Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Tourism and Sports, and Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. As for some ministries, i.e., Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Labor, and Ministry of Education, although the center has yet to be set up, there is already a mission under respective ministry to follow up, scrutinize, and clarify about distorted information and fake news, as well as to liaise with the National Anti-Fake News Center. In addition, the Government’s Department of Public Relations offers explanation on fake news on a regular basis via its website and Facebook “ข่าวจริงประเทศไทย”.
The Government Spokesperson added that the Prime Minister expressed concern over spread of fake news via various channels, especially during the COVID-19 situation which have caused public confusion and misunderstanding. Other than promptly clarifying these misunderstandings, the ministries are also ordered to take strict legal action against fake new spreaders directly without having to refer the cases to Ministry of Digital Economy and Society.
