Govt. Spokesperson calls on political protesters to take into consideration health safety of their own and families
Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri called on those who attended or wish to attend political rallies/activities to take into consideration their own safety and the safety of their family, community, and others. In addition, they may be charged with a criminal offence punishable by the imprisonment of not over 2 years or a fine of not over 40,000 Baht or both, as stipulated in the Emergency Decree, published in the Royal Gazette, on Public Administration in Emergency Situations, regarding the ban of activities/mass gatherings, including rallies, protests, and assemblies which may pose risk to the spread of COVID-19. The ban announcement has been in effect since August 3, 2021.
According to the Government Spokesperson, Ministry of Public Health has repeatedly made a warning on mass gatherings which would considerably increase the chance of virus transmission, and spread of the disease in the families and communities. However, he also affirmed the people’s right and freedom of political expression done in good faith, and thanked the majority of Thai people who have fully complied with various measures implemented by Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA). The Government Spokesperson added that complaints and report of misconduct could be made directly to the Prime Minister via Hotline 1111.
