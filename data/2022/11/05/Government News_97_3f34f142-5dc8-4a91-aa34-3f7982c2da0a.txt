Cabinet extends implementation of “We Travel Together” and “Tour Tiew Thai” schemes
September 21, 2021, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that the cabinet approved extension and criteria adjustment for the 3rd phase of “We Travel Together” and “Tour Tiew Thai” schemes, as proposed by Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT). The two tourism stimulus schemes will be extended to end on February 28, 2022, and registered participants may use their entitlements under these schemes until January 31, 2022. Gist is as follows:
1. “Tour Tiew Thai” scheme: two criteria will be adjusted, namely, 1) Easing restriction from traveling only during Sunday and Thursday to allow travelling any day of the week; 2) Increasing maximum number of tour packages per travel company from 15 to 30 packages.
Under the scheme, the Government will subsidize 40% of tour packages up to 5,000 baht a person from a minimum price of 12,500 baht.
2. “We Travel Together” scheme (3rd Phase): Registration will be opened for interested business operators during September 24- October 1, 2021. It is expected that the scheme be implemented in October 2021. Under the scheme, the Government will subsidize 40% of accommodation cost (but not over 3,000 Baht/room/night) and 40% of the airfare (not over 2,000-3,000 Baht depending on the destination), and provide an e-voucher of 600 Baht/day.
According to the Government Spokesperson, despite the fact that the COVID-19 situation has eased down, hotel/accommodation/shop operators are called on to strictly observe COVID-19 related measures and instructions in a bid to control and prevent spread of the disease in parallel with economic stimulation. If the COVID-19 situation regresses, the TAT may consider putting the 2 schemes to an earlier end.
