State enterprise investment for first half of 2021 is on target
August 12, 2021, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was reported on the investment of state enterprises, which has been the key engine of growth, especiallyduring this time when the private sector investment has slowed down due to the COVID-19 situation. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy Supattanapong Punmeechaow reported that during the first 6 months of 2021, Energy investment has generated over 100 billion Baht through various energy infrastructure projects, undertaken by PTT Public Company Limited, Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, and their affiliates. These projects include the new liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal in Rayong province, the fifth transmission pipeline project, and power transmission expansion project, among others. Investment in energy businesses for the year 2021 is targeted at 200 billion Baht.
For all the 43 state-owned enterprises, the State Enterprise Policy Office (STI) has reported that overall disbursement of FY2021 accumulated investment budget (as of June 2021) has been made either as planned or more than what has been planned, with the total disbursement of 191 billion Baht (101% of the accumulated disbursement plan). Mega projects, of which the disbursement was made more than what has been planned,are Thailand-China high-speed rail project Phase 1 (Bangkok-Nakhon Ratchasima section), the Red Line project (Bang Sue-Rangsit section), the High-Speed Rail Linked 3 Airport Project, and the Orange Line (Cultural Center-Minburi section).
According to the Deputy Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister has placed much importance on state enterprise investment, and ordered all concerned agencies to work closely with the state enterprises in a bid for all projects to achieve the set goal, and for the national economy to recover.
