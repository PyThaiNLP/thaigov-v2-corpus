Cabinet approves VAT exemption for Data Center operators
June 28, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that the cabinet, in its meeting today, approved in principle the draft Royal Decree Issued under the Revenue Code Regarding Exemption from Value-Added Tax (No. …), B.E. … (Tax measure to promote investment in Data Centre), as proposed by Ministry of Finance.
According to the Government Spokesperson, it is in the consideration of Ministry of Finance to provide tax privilege to promote investment in the Data Centre in accordance with the Government’s policy to elevate Thailand as Regional Digital Hub.
The draft Royal Decree Issued under the Revenue Code Regarding Exemption from Value-Added Tax (No. …), B.E. … (Tax measure to promote investment in Data Centre) prescribes VAT exemption for provision of servers host and related equipment to electronically store, process, and connect through internet network, as well as support services (disaster recovery sites, cloud computing, system management and information security services).
Eligible Data Centre operators must possess right qualifications and fully comply with criteria, procedures and conditions set and announced by Director-General of the Revenue Department. They must submit the request for VAT exemption to Director-General of the Revenue Department within 5 years after the date the Royal Decree takes effect.
With the exemption of VAT, it is expected that hyperscale Data Centre operation and related businesses, such as cloud computing, in the country increase, and that Thailand will become the Regional Digital Hub. Revenue earned from the collection of corporate income tax is also expected to compensate for the loss of VAT-related revenue.
