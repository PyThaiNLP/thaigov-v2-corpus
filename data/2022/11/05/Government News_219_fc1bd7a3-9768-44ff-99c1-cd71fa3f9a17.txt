January 24, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has closely monitored PM 2.5 situation, which is one of the Government’s national agenda, and related response plans.
The Department of Pollution Control has reported on January 23, 2022 that PM 2.5 particulates measured in all areas of Bangkok and vicinity is at a standard level, while the air quality is considered good and very good. PM 2.5 particulates measured in other regions is also within the safe threshold (below 50 micrograms per cubic meter), with the Northern region at 10 – 29 micrograms per cubic meter, the Northeastern region at 26 – 48 micrograms per cubic meter, Central and the Eastern regions at 11 – 48 micrograms per cubic meter, the Southern region, 10 – 18 micrograms per cubic meter, and Bangkok and vicinity 9 – 29 micrograms per cubic meter.
The Department of Pollution Control also forecasts that PM 2.5 level in 17 Northern provinces and Bangkok & vicinity will increase during January 25-28, 2022 due to the close weather and a drop in wind speed. In light of this, the people are urged to take precaution, limit their vehicle use and fine particulate-induced activities, always wear face masks, and not to burn stubbles or materials in open areas.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister has great concern over the Thai people’s health, especially those in the vulnerability groups. As the Chinese New Year is coming up, he called for the public cooperation not to burn joss paper and opt for shorter or electrical incense sticks.
