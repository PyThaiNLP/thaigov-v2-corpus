Prime Minister’s Statement on Holy Month of Ramadan (AH 1443)
April 2, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha delivered a statement on occasion of the Holy Month of Ramadan for AH 1443 to convey well wishes, and congratulate the Thai Muslims throughout the country for the chance to perform their religious ritual, and to express their respect and faith in Allāh with strong will and forbearance in fasting, refraining from bad deeds of all kinds, and treating others with kindness and non-violence, all of which are key fundamentals for pureness to the mind.
According to the Prime Minister, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may be an obstacle to performing the religious ritual, but such difficult situation would also be a good opportunity for the Thai Muslims to exercise mindfulness and perseverance, and to enhance mental strength and purity with strong faith, which would engender sustainable peace in the community, society, and the nation.
On the auspicious occasion of the Holy Month of Ramadan AH1443, the Prime Minister asked for the blessing of Allāh for the happiness and healthiness of all Muslims in Thailand. May they progress in lives and careers, and be crucial forces in the country’s peace building. He also wished for their prosperity, and success in all endeavors.
