​Govt Spokesperson: Positive outlook for Thai economic recovery in 2022 forecasted
December 16, 2021, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed about the Thai economic outlook in the first quarter of 2022 that the Thai economy is expected to continue growing. According to the World Bank, Thailand's economy is expected to grow 3.9% in 2022, comparing to the 1% growth this year. This is in line with the Bank of Ayudhya’s Krungsri Research which projects the recovery of private consumption at 3.6% in 2022, comparing to the 1.1% this year.
The factors that will contribute to economic growth and the increase of private confidence in 2022 are the Government’s ease of health measure control, and revival of service sector, especially tourism business which is a major driving force of Thai economy, as well as rapid and equitable vaccine distribution which will keep numbers of newly-infected patients at a low level.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Government continues to implement policies and measures that stimulate economic recovery, e.g., maintaining the Central Bank of Thailand’s policy rate at 0.5% until next year and the inflation rate at 1-3%. The Prime Minister also commits to enhance national competitiveness through utilizing innovations and digital technology to drive the economies and add value to goods and services.
