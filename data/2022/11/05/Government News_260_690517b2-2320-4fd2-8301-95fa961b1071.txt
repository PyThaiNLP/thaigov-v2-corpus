Seeking new measures to alleviate people’s financial burden on gas prices and utilities, especially the vulnerability groups
Establishing a working unit to propel the Government’s endeavor in addressing household debt problem. The Government has designated the year 2022 as “Year of Solving Household Debt Problem”, and identify the guideline to tackle the problem in an inclusive manner.
Expediting public investment in megaprojects, e.g., investment in the EEC, connectivity infrastructure development, cargo rail routes, etc., to enhance national competitiveness and ensure equitable distribution of income to people as a result of those investments.
