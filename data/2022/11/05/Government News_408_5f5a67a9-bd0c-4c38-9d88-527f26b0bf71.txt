Prayut Chan-o-cha, congratulated Ms. Apinya Tajit for her dedication to assisting victims of human trafficking around the world, which led Ms. Apinya, the only Thai to receive this year's TIP Heroes award.

The government Spokesperson added, "The Prime Minister is pleased and proud that Thai people are regarded as fighters in human trafficking and glad to Ms. Apinya for her dedication to helping victims of human trafficking until it is accepted at the international level. Emphasized that Thailand is ready to increase efficiency continuously in the fight against human trafficking from Thailand."
