PM pleased with expansion of export and inward foreign investment
April 27, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha is pleased with the country’s export performance. Important supporting factor for the expansion is the Government’s promotion of soft power policy.
Accordingly, Ministry of Commerce has focused on export promotion of products under 4 categories, namely, food, digital content, health and beauty, and Thai-identity products. In addition, the Ministry has implemented pro-active measures for fruit export and promoted border trade. Thailand’s major trade partners include the U.S., European countries, South Korea, Australia, and ASEAN countries.
According to the Government Spokesperson, Thai export value in March 2022 accounts for US$28,859.6 million (922,313 million Baht), an increase of 19.5% from the same month of last year. This marks the 13th consecutive monthly increase, and a 30-year record high since the data has ever been recorded in 1991. Import has also risen by 18% to US$27,400.6 million (887,353.2 million Baht), resulting in a trade surplus of US$1,459.1 million (34,960.1 million Baht).
With regard to inward foreign investment, the Foreign Business Commission has made approval to 53 foreign investors (17 approvals of business license, and 39 approvals of business certificate) in March 2022 to conduct business in Thailand, for the total investment value of 10,838 million Baht. As for the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) investment in March 2022, there are 10 investments (accounting for 19% of total investments) in the EEC, 29 investments (55%) in Bangkok, and 14 investments (26%) in other areas, for the total investment value of 6,323 million Baht. Countries with the highest investments are China (3 investors with an investment of 3,189 million Baht), Japan (2 investors with an investment of 630 million Baht), and the U.S. (1 investor with an investment of 637 million Baht). The rest are other countries.
According to the Government Spokesperson, an increase in export and inward foreign investment have demonstrated international confidence on Thailand’s potential. The Government also strives to strengthen the country from within through promoting the grassroots economy and supporting Thai investors and exporters at the international stage. This is for Thailand to become a high-income country with good quality of life and sustainable growth in all sectors.
