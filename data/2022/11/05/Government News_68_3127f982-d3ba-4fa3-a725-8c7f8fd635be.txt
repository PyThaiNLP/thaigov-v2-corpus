Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed about the handover of relief bags to the vulnerability groups, which include children, elderly people, persons with disabilities, homeless, bed-ridden patients, and the underprivileged, as well as people under the COVID-19 high-risk groups, who have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. The handover of the relief bags is the initiative of Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha with an aim to assist COVID-19 affected victims, in addition to other assistance measures being implemented. Office of Permanent Secretary to the Prime Minister's Office has used donated salaries of the Prime Minister, cabinet members, and the Government Spokesperson team, deposited in the bank account “Office of Permanent Secretary to the Prime Minister's Office for Donation to Relieve Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19)”, plus additional donations from the private and people sectors, for the preparation of the relief bags.
Each relief bag contains basic consumer goods for daily living, such as rice, dried food, alcohol gels, hygienic masks, and green chiretta herbal medicine, and was given to 5,000 people in the vulnerability groups in 50 areas during August 4-19, 2021. Additional relief bags will later be distributed to other 1,800 people to achieve the target of 6,800 people.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the bank account “Office of Permanent Secretary to the Prime Minister's Office for Donation to Relieve Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19)” is opened to receive donations to assist medical and concerned personnel, people in the vulnerability groups, and those in the maximum and strict controlled areas or dark-red zone provinces, as well as people across the country, who have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis.
The Government Spokesperson emphasized that it is the Prime Minister’s policy to help the people of all groups who have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis to alleviate their plights and boost their morale.
