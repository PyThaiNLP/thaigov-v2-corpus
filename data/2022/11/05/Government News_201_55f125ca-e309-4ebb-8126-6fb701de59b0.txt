January 5, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has closely followed up on post-New Year Holiday COVID-19 situation, after both public and private sectors have resumed their businesses, in order for the Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA), in its meeting on January 7, to come up with proper preventive measures and to take necessary action in a timely manner.
Today (January 5, 2022), a total of 3,899 new confirmed cases is reported, out of which 3,648 were found from the epidemiological surveillance system, 14 from proactive finding, 68 from correctional facilities, and 169 from overseas traveling.The total of 19 deaths and 2,508 recoveries are reported with 34,877 active cases. From April 1, 2021, cumulative number of cases are 2,210,612, and cumulative number of recoveries, 2,155,403.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Government will closely follow up and assess the situation, i.e., number of new cases and deaths, and the number of severe symptoms, for 4 weeks before making an adjustment to existing measures. People, especially those in the risk groups, are strongly urged to immediately get vaccination or a booster dose, which will help reduce fatality rate, while those who have been traveling or who are at risk are called on to undertake self-quarantine and undergo the COVID-19 test to minimize chance of disease spread.
The Government Spokesperson added that the people should still keep their guard up especially after the New Year Holidays by always wearing mask, washing hands, and keeping social distancing. They are urged to work from home for 14 days, and conduct ATK test once every 3 days.
