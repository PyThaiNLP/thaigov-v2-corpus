Prayut Chan-o-cha has closely followed up on the flash flood situation brought about by theTropical Storm Dianmu since September 23 until now.

According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister has genuine concern over the wellbeing of flood-affected victims, and instructed concerned ministries and agencies to provide immediate assistance, especially to vulnerable areas, such as hospitals, schools, temples, religious sites, and other public spaces. He also conveyed his appreciation toward all concerned officials, military officers, volunteers, and rescue workers who have joined forces in helping out the people in this difficult situation.

The Prime Minister only intended to provide moral support and boost their mental preparation against the difficult situation.
