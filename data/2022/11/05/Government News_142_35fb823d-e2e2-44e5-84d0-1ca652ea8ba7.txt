Govt Spokesperson: Survey shows investorconfidence for next 3 months in “very bullish” zone
November 4, 2021, Government Spokesperson ThanakornWangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was reported on “FETCO Investor Confidence Index (ICI)” for the next 3 months, a survey conducted in October 2021 by Federation of Thai Capital Market Organizations (FETCO), which is at 168.69, the highest score since its inauguration. The FETCO ICI is up 18.2% from last month and is considered in the “very bullish” zone. This is in line with the October-2021 Consumer Confidence Index (CCI), surveyed by the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce (UTCC), which is at 43.9, up for two months in a row, and is the highest in 5 months since June 2021.
The Prime Minister thanked the people and investors for having confidence in the country, and for their cooperation with the Government in its effort to curb the COVID-19 situation. Although people’s life and safety has been the Government’s high priority, it also strives to undertake economic rehabilitation to address bread and butter problem all at the same time. The Prime Minister also instructed concerned agencies to tackle hike of oil and vegetable prices, as well as decline of rice price.
According to the survey, investors and the people expect that revival of tourism industry under the country reopening plan be the key catalyst, followed by acceleration of vaccination distribution, and recovery of domestic economy. The people are confident with the Government’s ease of lockdown measures, curfew revocation, and the country reopening, as well as such economic stimulus measures as the Half-Half and We Travel Together schemes.
