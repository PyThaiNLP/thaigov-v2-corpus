Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha is scheduled to visit Washington D.C., United States of America during May 12-13, 2022, upon an invitation of U.S. President Joe Biden, to attend the 2nd ASEAN-U.S. Special Summit.

Other than attending the Special Summit, the Prime Minister is also scheduled to meet the U.S. leader and high-level officials to discuss cooperation on post-pandemic recovery and the region’s sustainable growth. He will also meet with the U.S. private sector to ensure them of Thailand’s readiness to transition into the next phase of country reopening and economic recovery, and affirmed the country’s aspiration to become the U.S.’s strong supply chain and partner in digital economy, sustainable development, clean energy, and EVs. The Prime Minister’s visit would also be a good opportunity to push forth Thailand’s hosting of APEC 2022 and the BCG Economic Model, which could be taken forward at the U.S.’s hosting of APEC 2023.
