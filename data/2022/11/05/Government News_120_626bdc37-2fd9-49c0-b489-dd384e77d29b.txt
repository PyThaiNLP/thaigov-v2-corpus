PM concerned over COVID-19 situation in 4 Southernmost provinces
October 18, 2021, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has great concern over the COVID-19 situation in the 4 Southernmost provinces, which saw an increase in the number of infected patients. He called on everyone, including those who have already received vaccination, to strictly conform to the universal prevention guideline, avoid mass gathering or unnecessary activities, regularly wash hands, and observe social distancing and mask wearing even at home. Cooperation has also been sought from shops, markets, and communities to elevate their safety measures for various activities and businesses under the COVID-Free setting. The Prime Minister also ordered law enforcement officials to ensure compliance of pubs/karaoke/entertainment places. If they are found selling alcohols, or opening beyond the restricted hours, which is deemed violating the Emergency Decree, they will be strictly prosecuted according to the law.
The Government Spokesperson added that the COVID-19 situation in Thailand has been on the positive trend. The Prime Minister also ordered concerned agencies to expedite vaccination, and distribution of ATKs and medical supplies. The integrative task force for COVID-19 situation administration in the Southernmost provinces, led by Gen Natthapol Nakpanich, an advisor to the Prime Minister, has been set up to work together with the local administrations in tightening control measures and locking down some areas in the provinces to promptly curb the spread of the disease.
