​PM orders concerned agencies to curb PM 2.5 particulates in Bangkok and vicinity
December 16, 2021, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has ordered concerned agencies to monitor and take immediate action against the increase of PM 2.5 particulates in Bangkok and vicinity to prevent adverse effect on people’s health. People from the high-risk groups should be surveyed and registered.
Following the Prime Minister’s order, Ministry of Public Health is now preparing to open an online pollution clinic, and set up pollution-free rooms in public healthcare facilities, and places with high-risk groups, i.e., daycare centers, elderly care centers, and houses. Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) has also undertaken measures to address the problem of PM2.5 particulates, e.g., road cleaning and tree watering. BMA also collaborates with the Thai Traffic Police, Department of Land Transport, and Bangkok Mass Transit Authority to strictly tighten traffic law enforcement to screen and bar black-smoke emitting vehicles from public roads.
Unsafe level of PM2.5 is expected in the area of Bangkok and vicinity during December 15-18, and 22-23 due to unfavorable weather condition.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister is concerned over people health caused by PM2.5 particulates, and urged them to refrain from outdoor activities in the areas where PM2.5 exceeds the standard level of 50 micrograms/cubic meter, and always wear mask to prevent both the dust and COVID-19. Concerned public agencies are also instructed to create public awareness on self-prevention against PM2.5.
