December 12, 2021, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha is pleased with Thailand being re-elected to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Council for 2020-2021 for the 9th consecutive term, and thanked IMO member countries for having faith in the country. He also commended concerned agencies for working hard to build up Thailand’s reputation and trustworthiness at both the regional and global stage.
On December 10, 2021, at the 32nd Session of the IMO Assembly, held in London, UK, Thailand received 107 votes out of the total of 180 votes casted and is among the twenty countries elected for Category C of the IMO Council (2022-2023). This is the 9th consecutive term which Thailand has served in the IMO Council, under Category “C”, since having been first elected in 2006.
IMO Council comprises 40 member states, each serving a two-year term, divided under three categories: (1) Category A: Ten states with the largest interests in providing international shipping services; (2) Category B: Ten states with the largest interests in international seaborne trade; and (3) Category C: Twenty states not elected in either categories A or B and which have special interests in maritime transportation or navigation.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister affirmed the Thai’s Government’s commitment to promote global partnership for maritime sustainability, and United Nations’ SDGs as part of the global cooperation to address challenges the whole world is facing.
