Ministry of Labor to provide compensation for workers confined in construction camps
June 26, 2021, Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed about a resolution of Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA), following its meeting with public health advisors, to temporarily close down and seal off construction sites in Bangkok and vicinity, and the 4 Southern border provinces, namely, Narathiwat, Pattani, Songkhla and Yala, for one month in a bid to control the COVID-19 pandemic, as the number of disease infected patients has significantly increased in many construction sites.
All workers will be confined within respective sites. Ministry of Labor is assigned to work together with the employers to scrutinize the list of workers in each site, and subsidize related costs incurred, i.e., meals and compensation to the workers during the temporary shutdown. The Ministry will also collaborate with Ministry of Interior to ensure common understanding of the measure among the entrepreneurs, and seek their cooperation to restrict worker movement during the one-month temporary closure. Only workers who are confined in the construction camps will be eligible for compensation, which is considered an event of unemployment due to force majeure. Police and security forces will also be deployed to ensure orderliness and security at each campsite during the one-month closure.
According to the Government Spokesperson, factories in Bangkok and vicinity, and the 4 Southern border provinces may continue their usual operation, but are subject to the Bubble & Seal measure, depending on the level of disease spread risk imposed.
