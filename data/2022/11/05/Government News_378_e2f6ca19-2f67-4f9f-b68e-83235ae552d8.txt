The government encourages the tourism sector to organize a campaign to launch a promotion to attract more tourists. IATA estimated that more than 10 million foreign visitors would enter Thailand this year.
On June 27, 2022, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed that the Ministry of Transport has reported to Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha that the International Air Transport Association, or IATA, has forecast air traffic and the number of international travelers arriving in Thailand in 2022 would exceed 10 million people, with the rise in travelers being in line with the world.
By now, the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) has communicated with all airlines and airport operators to arrange flights and flight slots and increase personnel according to the number of passengers. In particular, from July 1, 2022, onwards, international arrivals will be higher after the easing of registration in the Thailand Pass system for foreigners travelling to the country.
Ms. Traisuree said that both the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports had discussed and agreed that the government's lessening measures on supporting the entry of foreign tourists will attract many tourists to a certain extent. However, if the tourism business sector, including accommodation, restaurants, and tourist attractions, creates campaigns promoting activities to attract tourists, this will be effective in attracting travellers to choose Thailand as a final destination.
"The government welcomes entrepreneurs in the tourist sector to cooperate with the government in revitalizing the tourism sector by issuing marketing activities." There are diverse promotions to develop attractions for tourists to travel to Thailand. After the easing of government measures coupled with the attraction of the private sector, this will have sufficient impact and help the Thai tourism sector recover rapidly," said Ms. Traisuree.
Several foreign tourist arrivals to Thailand totaled 2,027,230 people from January 1 to June 26, 2022, with the top five countries entering Thailand the most: India with 220,962 people; Malaysia with 184,782 people; the United Kingdom with 121,328; Singapore with 121,264; and the United States with 102,964.
The top five are: Suvarnabhumi Airport, with 1,224,951 people; Phuket Airport, with 472,276 people; Don Mueang Airport, with 91,001 people; Sadao checkpoint, with 56,186 people; and Nong Khai checkpoint, with 28,579 people.
