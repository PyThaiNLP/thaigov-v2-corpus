Cabinet approves Thailand-US Agreement on donation of COVID-19 vaccines
Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that the cabinet, in its meeting on July 6, 2021, has made approval to an agreement with the US to accept the latter’s offer on donation of COVID-19 vaccines to Thailand as part of the country’s plan to donate 80 million doses of surplus COVID-19 vaccines globally.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the supply of COVID-19 vaccines reflects close and long-standing relations between Thailand and the US. Since the beginning of the outbreak, the US has provided assistance to Thailand through Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with the close collaboration with Thai Ministry of Public Health.
With regard to the donation, concerned agencies, i.e., Ministry of Public Health and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will collaborate with the US agency for immediate delivery of the vaccines, which are to be promptly allocated and distributed to the target groups.
On behalf of the Thai Government, the Government Spokesperson expressed appreciation for the assistance and continued cooperation of the US and the US Embassy in Thailand. The Thai Government commits to mitigate the disease spread to the best of its ability, and lead Thailand out of the situation the soonest.
