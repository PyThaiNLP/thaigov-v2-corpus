PM orders concerned agencies to mobilize personnel and equipment in preparation for possible flash flood
August 2, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has closely followed up on the rainfall situation, following an announcement of the National Water Command Center on “Alert for Flood-Prone Areas and Flash Flood” due to continued heavy rainfall forecasted during August 2-10, 2022.
According to the announcement, more rain and isolated heavy showers is forecasted during the period. Coupling with possible overflow from rivers and natural water sources in some areas, inundation and flash flood may occur as a result. People in the flood-prone areas, especially the Mekong provinces, i.e., Chiang Rai, Loei, Nongkhai, Beung Kan, Nakhon Phanom, Mukdahan, Amnat Charoen, and Ubon Ratchathani, are strongly advised to keep updated on the water situation, and take precaution on the sudden increase of water level in the Mekong River.
As a preparation and precaution, the Prime Minister instructed concerned agencies to continue monitoring the daily weather and water situation, especially in the areas with over 90mm of accumulated rainfall in 24 hours and in flood-prone areas. Possible water obstructions must be cleared, and reservoirs and related constructions, as well as river banks, must be checked to ensure that they remain intact. Personnel and equipment, including backup communication system, must be mobilized for prompt deployment. Concerned agencies are also ordered to warn the people, who may be impacted, to consider advance evacuation which should considerably minimize the damage.
