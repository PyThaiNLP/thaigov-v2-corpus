Thailand to host 2022 Global Summit of Women during June 23-25
Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha is pleased with Thailand’s hosting of the 2022 Global Summit of Women. This shows confidence of the international community on Thailand’s economy and its endeavor to empower women in business and economic sectors at both the regional and global levels.
The 2022 Global Summit of Women will be held during June 23-25, 2022 in Bangkok, under the theme: “Women: Creating Opportunities in the New Reality”. Thailand will have an honor to welcome approx. 1,000 participants from over 60 countries. The event will be the first face-to-face international conference in 2 years, and a good opportunity for the country to be recognized as MICE powerhouse and world destination for both international meetings/conferences and tourism. It is expected that the 2022 Global Summit of Women generate over 80 million Baht in revenue to the country.
According to Thailand Convention and Exhibition Bureau (Public Organization) (TCEB), even though Thailand has been hit hard by the COVID-19 situation, last year, the country’s MICE industry has generated the revenue of over 33.2 billion Baht and more than 46,000 jobs. In 2022, aside from 23 TCEB-supported international events to be organized in Thailand, the 2022 APEC Summit, which is scheduled to be held in Bangkok during November 18-19, 2022, will be another highlight that attracts global attention toward the country.
The Government Spokesperson added that the Prime Minister has accepted to chair and deliver a keynote address at the opening ceremony of the 2022 Global Summit of Women on June 23, 2022.
