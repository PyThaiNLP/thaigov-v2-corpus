PM thanks Japan for donating additional AstraZeneca vaccines
October 15, 2021, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that the Japanese Government has announced its donation of additional 385,210 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine to Thailand. The vaccine will be sent out from Japan today (October 15) and will arrive Thailand late night.
According to the Government Spokesperson, Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha expressed appreciation toward the Japanese Government for continuous provision of assistance to Thailand in its endeavor to mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 situation. So far, Japan has donated a total of 2,043,100 AstraZeneca shots, produced in the country, in 4 different occasions. It has also given oxygen concentrators, and provided assistance in vaccine delivery. Japan-donated COVID-19 vaccines would enhance Thailand’s equitable distribution of vaccines, and mitigate the situation for the country’s economy to recover.
The Government Spokesperson added that Japan has been a good and supportive friend of Thailand. The Prime Minister has also placed importance on the reinforcement of relations between the two countries, and has just discussed with H.E. Mr. Nashida Kazuya, Ambassador of Japan to Thailand to seek opportunity for further cooperation, both at the bilateral and multilateral levels.
