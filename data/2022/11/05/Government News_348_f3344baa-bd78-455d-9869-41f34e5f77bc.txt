Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that on June 3, 2022, at 01.15 hrs, Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha attended the House of Representatives’ session to deliberate the draft Annual Budget Expenditure Act, B.E. 2566 (2023), and reaffirmed that the Government drafted the FY2023 budget expenditure in a very prudent manner. He attentively participated in the session although occasional absence was unavoidable due to scheduled duties. The Prime Minister also thanked the House Speaker and MPs for approving in principle the draft Annual Budget Expenditure Act, B.E. 2566 (2023) at the first reading, with 278 votes in favor, 192 against, and 2 abstentions. An extraordinary committee for considering the draft Annual Budget Expenditure Act B.E. 2566, comprising 72 members, has also been set up.
The Prime Minister also thanked the House Speaker and members of the Parliament for sharing their thoughts and observations. Even though the FY2023 budget expenditure has been drafted under the tight budget framework, priority has been placed on the best interest of the people and the country. The FY2023 budget expenditure is a continuation of the FY2022 which aims to promote post COVID-19 socio-economic recovery, and mobilize national development under the National Strategy through creating opportunities and equality, and reducing disparity.
He also asked the established extraordinary committee to take the observations made during the first reading into consideration in its scrutiny of the draft 2023 budget.
