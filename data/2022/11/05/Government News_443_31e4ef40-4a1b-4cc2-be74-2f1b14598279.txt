​Govt Spokesperson: CCSA to reassess post-pandemic transition in September
August 22, 2022, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri affirmed that the Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) in its meeting on August 19, 2022, chaired by Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha, has not made any decision on the revocation of the Emergency Decree as it needs to further assess the situation by September when the 19th extension of the Emergency Decree nationwide as a result of the COVID-19 situation will come to an end.
According to the Acting Government Spokesperson, the nationwide Emergency Decree has been put in place solely for concerned authorities to tackle the COVID-19 situation, and to strictly and efficiently control the spread of the disease. Thailand’s response against the COVID-19 pandemic has been recognized internationally to the point where some countries express interest to learn from Thailand’s experiences.
Although revocation of the Emergency Decree has not been raised for discussion, the meeting deliberated policy framework, guidelines and timeline for the post-pandemic transition under the principle “to allow people to live with COVID-19 safely and be able to lead normal lives”, taking into account the current situation, risk, and preventive measures. At present, over 90% of Thai people have been immune, and over 90% of them received the 3rd shot of vaccine. It is expected that future COVID-19 infection will be in the similar manner as influenza which may be found throughout the year, with mild symptoms, except those in the 608 groups.
CCSA will meet to reassess the post-pandemic transition before October 1 to ensure that there will be no negative consequences in all dimensions, and to prepare response plan in case that such consequences are inevitable.
