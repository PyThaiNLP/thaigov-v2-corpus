​PM orders concerned agencies to immediately address fresh food price hikes
January 13, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has concerned over the price hike of necessities and goods, especially fresh meat and food, and ordered concerned agencies, i.e., Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Energy, to hold talk with consumer goods producers on price freeze in a bid to help alleviate people’s burden on cost of living.
So far, concerned agencies have closely followed up on the situation and provided immediate help to the people. Ministry of Commerce has discussed with Thai President Foods, Public Company Limited, “Mama” instant noodle manufacturer, to peg the instant noodle prices, as it is the country’s popular consumable product.
Ministry of Energy, through the National Energy Policy Council, has also made a decision to extend LPG price control at 318 Baht/tank of 15 kilograms for another 2 months to end on March 31, 2022. Cooperation has also been sought from PTT Public Company Limited (PTT) to provide discount on LPG price for small shops and food street vendors through state welfare card from now until March 31, 2022, and to peg NGV retail price at 15.59 Baht/kg. PTT was also asked to maintain NGV retail price under the “NGV for the Same Breath” scheme for taxi drivers in Bangkok and vicinity at 13.62 Baht/kg for another month (February 16- March 15, 2022).
According to the Government Spokesperson, price hike of consumer products is the result of constant increase of gasoline prices in the global market which has affected manufacturing cost, transport, etc. The Government has laid out both short and long-term response plans, but meanwhile private sector and entrepreneurs are urged to peg prices of goods and necessities to minimize people’s burden.
