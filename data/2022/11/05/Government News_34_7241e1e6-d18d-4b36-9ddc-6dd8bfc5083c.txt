PM chairs opening of Southeast Asia’s first-ever battery pilot plant
July 19, 2021, at 1000hrs, at Bhakdi Bodin Building, Government House, Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha presided over via a video conference the opening of the Battery Pilot Plant, which is the first of its kind in the Southeast Asian region.
Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that the opening of the Battery Pilot Plant is a stepping stone for Thailand’s progress in the development of technology and innovation, especially in response to the Government’s policy regarding energy transition to renewable energy (solar, wind, or water). This is also in line with global policy to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to net zero by 2050, and the national energy plan which also aims for carbon neutrality and reduction of GHG emission. The Battery Pilot Plant would boost the country’s opportunity to become ASEAN’s EV manufacturing hub, and promote public-private sector cooperation, both Thai and international partners, as well as enhance national competitiveness in a tangible manner.
The Prime Minister congratulated the opening of Southeast Asia’s first Battery Pilot Plant, and emphasized that the Government strives to work for the country’s presence and future, and would continue to work together with the private sector to ensure that high revenue is generated from technology and innovations.
