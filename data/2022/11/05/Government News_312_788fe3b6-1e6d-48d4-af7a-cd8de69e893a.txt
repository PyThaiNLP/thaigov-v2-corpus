PM warns business entrepreneurs to increase product prices appropriately according to Ministry of Commerce's regulation
April 29, 2022, at 1000hrs, at the Government House, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha expressed concern over the problem of product price hikes, and affirmed the Government’s effort to alleviate people’s plights through the implementation of various measures. Budget, though limited, has been optimized to control manufacturing cost, which normally affects the increase of product prices.
The Prime Minister insisted that the Government has never been idle in addressing problems, especially those regarding labor, minimum wage rate, and energy price hike. He has handed down a policy for concerned agencies to come up with proper measures and solutions to mitigate people’s plights, taking into consideration the readily-available budget, as it is also important not to impose a burden on the future. Priority now is to ensure people’s safety from the COVID-19 pandemic and for them to live a life of self-sufficiency according to their potential.
The Prime Minister also emphasized the importance of policy adjustment according to the change of global context and situation, taking into account related lessons learned. The Government has already come up with policies to accommodate these future changes. Nevertheless, for now, business operators and entrepreneurs are urged to adjust product prices appropriately in accordance with Ministry of Commerce's regulations, and in line with actual manufacturing cost and the inflation situation.
