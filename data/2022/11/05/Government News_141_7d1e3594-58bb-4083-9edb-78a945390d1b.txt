Govt Spokesperson discloses success of PM’s participation in COP26
November 3, 2021, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha, together with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Don Pramudwinai, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Varawut Silpa-archa, and the delegation, is scheduled to return to Thailand tonight following his participation in the World Leaders Summit for the 26th United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties (UNFCCC COP26) held in Glasgow, United Kingdom on November 1-2, 2021. The Prime Minister’s attendance at COP26 in Glasgow was his first trip abroad in 2 years. The aim was to represent Thailand at the international stage, and demonstrate the country’s commitment to collaborate with all countries and sectors to reach the world’s common goal against the climate change, and to be more aggressive in addressing the climate change challenges in every way and every means possible. This is in a bid for Thailand to achieve carbon neutrality in 2050, and Net Zero Emission in or before 2065.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister has given a policy for all public agencies to collaborate with other sectors in taking and implementing climate action, i.e., revising related policies, laws, and energy practices to reduce GHG, especially in the energy, transport, and agricultural sectors. Thailand also sets the direction to actively mobilize and integrate operation in various dimensions:
- Policy and laws: such as the Climate Change Act, and Thailand’s Nationally Determined Contribution Roadmap 2021-2030
- Engagement of all sectors: such as public-private partnership, action plan on GHG emission reduction at a provincial level, green production and consumption
- Technology and innovation: such as use of electric vehicles (EV), carbon dioxide emission database, clean energy, GEO-Engineering
- Budget and investment: such as Bank of Thailand’s green loan against climate change, budget allocation for green infrastructure and environment.
The Government Spokesperson added that the Prime Minister’s instruction on the planning for comprehensive climate actions would help Thailand fulfill its pledge made to the international community in addressing the climate change.
