Govt Spokesperson: PM is not against mixing and matching of COVID-19 vaccines
July 14, 2021, Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha handed down a policy for immediate acquisition and provision of COVID-19 vaccines to the public. According to medical statistics, although vaccination may not stop the people from catching the virus, it substantially reduces the severity of symptoms and fatality, especially in the elderlies and those with underlying diseases.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister is not against the mixing and matching of COVID-19 vaccines, but would like to call on all sectors to take into consideration advices of the National Communicable Disease Committee. This is in line with the World Health Organization's chief scientistSoumya Swaminathan’s concern over the issue, as she said that it would be a little bit of a dangerous trend, and people should follow public health advice and not make their own decisions on vaccine mixing or taking additional doses. She also suggested that public health agencies provide advice based on available data, and that immunogenicity and safety both need to be evaluated.
