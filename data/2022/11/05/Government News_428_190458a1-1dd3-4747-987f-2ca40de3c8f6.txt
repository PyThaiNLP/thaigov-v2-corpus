Cabinet acknowledges official Thai spelling and pronunciation for “Republic of Türkiye”
Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed that the cabinet, in its meeting on August 9, 2022, acknowledged change of official name of the Republic of Turkey to “Republic of Türkiye”, and the Thai spelling and pronunciation for the country’s new official name.
Following an official letter submitted to the United Nations by the Republic of Türkiye, requesting the use of “Türkiye” instead of “Turkey” for all affairs, the country's name has been officially changed to Türkiye at the UN. The Embassy of the Republic of Türkiye to Thailand has also submitted request for the change of name to the Thai authority for all affairs related to bilateral relations and cooperation.
Upon the request of Ministry of Foreign Affairs to deliberate spelling and pronunciation of the “Republic of Türkiye” in Thai, the Royal Society of Thailand has given its comment that the name of the country remains unchanged for the sake of public convenience and familiarity. In light of this, one can use either “สาธารณรัฐตุรกี” or “สาธารณรัฐทูร์เคีย” for “Republic of Türkiye”, and either “ตุรกี” or “ทูร์เคีย” for “Türkiye”, as appropriate.
