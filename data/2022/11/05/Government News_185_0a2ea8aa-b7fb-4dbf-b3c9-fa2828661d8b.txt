Govt strives to ensure easy and fair access to vaccines to prevent all variants of COVID-19
December 19, 2021, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has closely followed up on the COVID-19 situation, especially vaccination to the public, and emphasized the importance of equitable distribution of vaccines to the people of all groups. He also conveyed his thankfulness to all the medical personnel and volunteers for joining forces in providing vaccination service to the people.
For Bangkok, a new vaccine registration channel has been launched. “QueQ” application can be accessed by the people of all groups and nationalities. Registration may be made for both first-time vaccine recipients, and those who want the 2nd shot and the booster dose. Vaccination venues offered under the application are: 1) Bangkok Youth Center (Thai - Japanese), 2) 11 hospitals under the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), and 3) 6 healthcare facilities under BMA’s Health Department.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister strongly encouraged those who have not been vaccinated to receive vaccine at various vaccination sites across the country to enhance immunity against COVID-19 and reduce mortality risk. The Government would do anything to ensure everyone’s easy access to vaccination service, while the people are also urged to strictly observe self-protection, i.e., always wearing mask, keeping social distancing, and often washing hands.
