April 6, 2022, at 17.00 hrs, at the statue of King Rama I, Phra Phutta Yodfah Bridge, Prime Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha laid wreaths in front of King Rama I’s statue on occasion of the Chakri Day. Attending the wreath-laying ceremony in remembrance of the First King of Chakri Dynasty was Prime Minister’s Secretary General Distat Hotrakitya.
Upon arrival, the Prime Minister bowed and presented the flower offerings, before laying 2 wreaths in the name of the Prime Minister and on behalf of the cabinet members. He, then, bowed again to complete the ceremony.
In 1919, King Rama VI proclaimed April 6 of each year as “King Phra Phutta Yodfah Chulaloke Maharaj Day” in order for the Thai people to express reverence and remember the benevolences of all the Chakri Kings. April 6, 1782 marks the beginning of Chakri Dynasty and Bangkok, as capital of the nation, when King Rama I ascended to the throne.
