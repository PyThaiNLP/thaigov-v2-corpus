Govt aims to acquire 150 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine by mid-2022
Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed about the Government’s plan on acquisition of COVID-19 vaccines that the plan remains unchanged, which is to acquire 150 million doses of vaccine by mid-2022.
The cabinet has also made approval to the procurement of alternative vaccines with different technologies to tackle various variants of the COVID-19 virus. Thailand has, so far, negotiated for the acquisition of over 105.5 million doses of primary vaccines (AstraZeneca, Sinovac, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson), which is administered by the Government to be given to the public free of charge. The rest will be further acquired to reach the targeted 150 million doses within mid-2022.
Alternative vaccines of approx. 10 million doses (Sinopharm and Moderna) will be procured by the private sector through the arrangement of Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) since vaccine producers have made clear that the vaccines for emergency use must only be sent to a government agency of each country. So far, over 2 million doses of Sinopharm vaccines have been offered by Chulabhorn Royal Academy.
According to the Government Spokesperson, cumulative number of COVID-19 vaccinations from February 28- July 9, 2021 is 12,403,255 doses (first jab: 9,156,006, and second jab: 3,247,248). In Bangkok alone, cumulative number of given vaccines accounts for 4 million doses (first jab: 2,196,456, and second jab: 895,830).
