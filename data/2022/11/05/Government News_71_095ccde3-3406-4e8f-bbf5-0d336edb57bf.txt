Spokespersons of each ministry agree on response guideline against fake/distorted news
Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that on August 23, 2021, spokesperson of 20 ministries were invited to attend a virtual meeting of ministerial spokespersons, which was also participated by representative of the Anti-Fake News Center Thailand. The meeting was aimed to ensure common understanding among ministerial spokespersons on the instruction given by Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha regarding the integrative operation between ministerial spokespersons, the Department of Public Relations, and Anti-Fake News Center Thailand on fake news management.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister has placed much concern on the widespread of fake and distorted news which have been forwarded throughout the social media and online platforms. Each ministry was earlier ordered to set up its own anti-fake news center, while Office of the Government Spokesperson has been working together with the Public Relations Department, Office of the Public Sector Development Commission, and the Anti-Fake News Center Thailand to include fake/distorted news clarification as part of the public relations missions of government agencies and ministerial spokespersons. The Prime Minister also ordered the Anti-Fake News Center Thailand, Office of the Government Spokesperson, and Public Relations Department to identify fake/distorted news, and promptly notify concerned ministries for their immediate public clarification action. Fake news clarification will also be taken as a key performance indicator of heads of public agencies and organizations, and state enterprises.
The Government Spokesperson added that the Prime Minister is especially concerned over fake news related to the issues of national security, economy and society, and public health (the COVID-19 situation) which aim to discredit the Government and public agencies, and to create impact on public safety. The meeting of ministerial spokespersons also approved the more prompt and efficient response guidelines against fake/distorted news, and discussed public relations implementation to create awareness of the people for their utmost interest.
