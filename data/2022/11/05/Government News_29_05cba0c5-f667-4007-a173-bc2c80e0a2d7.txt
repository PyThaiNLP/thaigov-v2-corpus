Govt Spokesperson: Alternative vaccines exempted from VAT
Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri has made clarification about taxation over the imported alternative COVID-19 vaccines that the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) does not impose extra profit nor import tax over the price of Moderna vaccines sold to private hospitals. The selling price has been determined based on its cost, set by the agent, Zuellig Pharma LTD., plus VAT and other standard expenses, i.e., storage and delivery fees, and personal insurances to cover vaccine recipients in case of any side effect.
The Customs Department also made clear that vaccines and medical equipment for treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of COVID-19, listed by Ministry of Public Health, are already exempted from import taxes until March 2022. Only 7% VAT has been imposed on the importers.
On the news spread via the social network that VAT would be imposed on those who pay for the alternative vaccines at the private hospitals, the Revenue Department clarified that hospital services are exempted from VAT according to the Medical Facility Act. Therefore, VAT cannot be collected from the purchase of vaccines.
