Cabinet approves extension of stay in Thailand for migrant workers under MOU
March 15, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that the cabinet approved in principle the draft Interior Ministerial on exemption of prohibition against aliens’ entry into the Kingdom as a special case for migrant workers of Cambodian Laos and Myanmar nationalities on a memorandum of understanding (MoU) under the 2019 Agreement. This is to allow migrant workers from Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar who entered Thailand on a memorandum of understanding (MoU) under the 2019 Agreement to extend their stay in the country for another 6 months to sort out their employment status and work permits, which may be extended up to 2 years.
These migrant workers, whose 4-year employment term will end this year (January 1 and December 31, 2022) will be able to apply for work permit or extension of work permit or temporary stay for not more than 2 years without having to leave the country. The extension is approved to solve the problem of workers’ reentry into the country, control the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, and to help businesses that rely on migrant workers to be able to operate, thereby, propelling and revitalizing national economic system.
At present, there are 106,580 on a memorandum of understanding (MoU) under the 2019 Agreement (26,840 from Cambodia, 25,504 from Lao PDR, and 54,236 from Myanmar).
