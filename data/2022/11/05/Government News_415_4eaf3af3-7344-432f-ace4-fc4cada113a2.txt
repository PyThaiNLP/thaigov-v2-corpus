July 25, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was reported on Thailand’s monkeypox situation, following an announcement of World Health Organization (WHO) to declare growing monkeypox outbreak the “Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)”. According to the report, aside from the case of an infected Nigerian man who had illegally stayed in the country, additional case of monkeypox infection has not been found domestically.
