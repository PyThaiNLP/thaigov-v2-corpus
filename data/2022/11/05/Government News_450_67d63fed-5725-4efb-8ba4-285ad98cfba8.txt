Gist of the meeting is as follows:
The Deputy Prime Minister welcomed Malaysian Senior Minister of Works and the delegation to Thailand, and emphasized that this would be a good opportunity for both sides to push ahead infrastructure development and transport connectivity in the Southern border provinces along Thailand-Malaysia border in a tangible manner, in accordance with the agreement made between Prime Ministers of Thailand and Malaysia during the latter’s official visit to Thailand in February 2022. He was of the view that a meeting mechanism be established to enhance cooperation in transport connectivity between the two countries.
Malaysian Senior Minister of Works expressed honor to meet with the Deputy Prime Minister to follow up on the progress of the agreements made between Prime Ministers of the two countries, and discuss transport connectivity promotion, on which concerned agencies of both Thailand and Malaysia have been working closely together toward tangible outcomes. During the visit, the delegation of Malaysian Senior Minister had a chance to learn from the Thai counterpart good practices and experiences on construction, design, and maintenance.
Both parties also discussed tangible advancement of pending connectivity projects, especially construction of the 2nd Sungai Golok - Rantau Panjang Bridge, and Tak Bai - Pengkalan Kubor Bridge, which the Malaysian Senior Minister of Works committed to expedite. They also agreed to push forward construction of a road linkage between Thailand’s new Sadao Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) checkpoint and Malaysia’s Bukit Kayu Hitam Immigration, Customs, Quarantine and Security (ICQS) checkpoint through the 2nd meeting of Thailand-Malaysia Expert Working Group (EWG), to be held in December. Both the Deputy Prime Minister and Malaysian Senior Minister of Works were confident that these connectivity projects would enhance people-to-people exchange and promote linkage between special economic zones in the border areas of the two countries.
