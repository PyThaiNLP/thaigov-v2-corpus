Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was pleased with Thailand being ranked at 11th as the world’s best places to retire in 2022, and 1st among the Asian countries. The ranking was conducted and announced by International Living Magazine on January 1, 2022. The Prime Minister took pride with Thailand’s uniqueness and identity, as well as Thai people’s hospitality, which attracts foreign visitors and tourists.
The International Living’s Retirement Index is a comprehensive and in-depth survey, compiled from hundreds of opinions and real-life experiences by trusted sources in the best retirement destinations across the globe. The index was considered based on 4 categories: overview, financial, lifestyle, and governance. Sub-categories include climate, healthcare, cost of living, housing, visas & residence, development, and benefits & discounts.
According to the Government Spokesperson, Thailand’s high rank at the International Living’s Retirement Index is deemed a result of the Government’s implementation of economic and investment stimulus measures, which facilitate foreign travelers and investors, and long-term stay of high potential foreigners.
