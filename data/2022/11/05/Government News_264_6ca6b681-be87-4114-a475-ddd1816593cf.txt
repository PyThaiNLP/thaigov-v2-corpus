March 8, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha is scheduled to chair the meeting of Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) on March 18, 2022.
According to the Government Spokesperson, CCSA, in its meeting on March 18, will deliberate safety measures for Songkran Holidays and other related measures in hope that the people could spend their Songkran festival at least near normally. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister expressed concern over certain activities that could heighten the risk of COVID-19 transmission, especially family gatherings, water pouring, and any other entertaining activities.
The Prime Minister also affirmed that the Government does not plan to bar the celebration of Songkran this year, which includes cross-provincial travel. However, all the activities must be done under the measure of VUCA (Vaccine, Universal Prevention, Covid Free Setting, ATK). It is also strongly suggested that everyone in the family receive a booster dose (especially those under the 608 group, which comprises people aged 60 years or more, people with a chronic illness, and pregnant women), and undergo an ATK test both before and after their travel.
