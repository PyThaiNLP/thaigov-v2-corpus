​PM thanks rural doctors for taking part in active case finding operation in Bangkok
August 8, 2021, Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha commended 38 teams of rural doctors across the country who have taken part in the active case finding in Bangkok and vicinity, in accordance with the guideline of Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) and Ministry of Public Health, with the aim to early identify and isolate infected patients. Those who are asymptomatic or show little sign of symptom will be put under either home isolation or community isolation, and will be given green chiretta extracts (Andrographis paniculate) or Favipiravir. This is in order to reduce disease transmission, and enhance disease control efficiency in Bangkok.
Among the 38 rural doctor teams, 6 are from the North, 10 from the Central region, 2 from the East, 12 from the Northeast, and 8 from the South. Their active case finding operation is scheduled during August 4-10, 2021, with the goal to screen the total of 250,000 people. As of August 5, the ATK test has been conducted on 30,407 people, among whom 3,298 (10.8%) are found infected.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister praised the rural doctor teams, as well as volunteers from the people sector, for their sacrifice and support on the endeavor to control the spread of COVID-19, together with Ministry of Public Health, National Health Security Office, and Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. He expressed confidence that such solidarity of the Thai people would soon lead Thailand through the COVID-19 crisis.
