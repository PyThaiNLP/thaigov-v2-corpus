Prime Minister stated that “THAILAND MUST OPEN IN 120 DAYS”
June 14, 2021, at 1500 hrs. Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha delivery his statement on National Broadcasting Television highlights as follow:
“It has now been just over a month since we returned to a consolidated management of the Covid-19 crisis, which has enabled me to instruct certain actions directly to facilitate the integration of plans among our various teams and committees and quickly solve problems that may naturally arise in the implementation of a such a large undertaking that involves so many different departments...This is the way that we worked when the Covid-19 pandemic started last year… …It is an arrangement that has enabled us to make some fast progress in negotiations with new suppliers of vaccines.…We have also secured the supply of more vaccines [with] signed reservation and supply contracts for 105.5 million doses to be delivered this year and putting us ahead of our target for vaccine supplies this year.”
“The time has now come for us to look ahead and set a date for when we can fully open our country and start receiving visitors because re-opening the country is one of the important ways to start reducing the enormous suffering of people who have lost their ability to earn an income. I am, therefore, setting a goal for us to be able to declare Thailand fully open within 120 days from today, and for tourism centers that are ready, to do so even faster.The only exception to these guidelines will be if a truly serious situation develops or seems likely to develop, and we will look at those situations on a case-by-case basis.”
“I know this decision comes with some risk because when we open the country there will be an increase in infections, no matter how good our precautions.But, I think, when we take into consideration the economic needs of people, the time has now come for us to take that calculated risk.The priorities for our country must now advance to the next level.”
“Our national policy must now evolve and we must look on this virus just as we would on the many other diseases that are in the world and with which we must learn to live.We have seen that this virus is not going to go away quickly.We have to come to terms that it will continue to be around in the world and in Thailand for some time.We cannot wait for a time when everyone is fully vaccinated with two shots to open the country or for when the world is free of the virus.We must be ready to live with some risk and just try to keep it at a manageable level, and let people go back to being able to earn a living.That is the policy that I have set.”
