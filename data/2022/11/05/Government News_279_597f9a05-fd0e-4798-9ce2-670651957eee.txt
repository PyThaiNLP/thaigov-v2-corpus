March 21, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has closely followed up on the connectivity development of Thai transport system with the target, set under the 20th National Strategy (2018- 2037), to boost Thailand’s role as ASEAN’s logistics hub in all four dimensions, through such projects as the development of M-Flow system, construction of motorways, MRT system connectivity, Southern Land Bridge project to facilitate cargo transport between the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea, etc.
One of the projects, the construction of 96.41-km Bang Yai - Kanchanaburi Intercity Motorway (M81), has made a considerable progress. The Department of Highway reported that the project has now made 72% progress, and is expected to complete by November 2023. Bang Yai – Kanchanaburi Intercity Motorway is one of the PPP fast-track projects that connects Bangkok and metropolitan areas to the western and southern provinces of Thailand, and promises to improve transportation system in Thailand in terms of safety, efficiency, and logistics integration. Once completed, traveling from Bang Yai (Nonthaburi province) to Kanchanaburi province will take only 48 minutes, instead of the normal 2.30 hours via regular highway.
