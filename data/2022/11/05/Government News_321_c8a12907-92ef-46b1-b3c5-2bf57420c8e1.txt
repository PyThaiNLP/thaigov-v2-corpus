Prayut Chan-o-cha gave a press briefing on the nation’s economic rehabilitation. He expressed content on an increase in number of the incoming tourists, which, if the trend continues to be this way, would positively contribute to the country’s economy at the end of the 4th quarter. Nevertheless, the people are urged to join hands in ensuring peacefulness and public health safety of the country in a bid to boost confidence of the tourists.
The Prime Minister also mentioned about Thailand’s preparation to bid for the hosting of the Specialized Expo 2028 which is now underway, and stated that he had ordered concerned agencies to seek proper measures to further promote film production in Thailand, and to encourage more spending of both short and long-term foreign tourists in order to increase revenues. The Government also strives to help hoteliers who need financial support for post-COVID hotel renovation. The Prime Minister affirmed that the Government has utilized the budget carefully. All the projects and measures implemented are aimed for the best interest of the people.
