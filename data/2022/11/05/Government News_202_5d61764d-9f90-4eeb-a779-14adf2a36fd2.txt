​PM orders tightening of border surveillance to prevent drug smuggling and illegal entry
January 6, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has made an order to law enforcement officials, military, police, and provincial governors of all the border provinces to tighten surveillance to prevent smuggling of drugs and illegal entry of migrant labors. The Prime Minister’s order came after he was reported on the recently increasing number of drug smuggling and illegal entry cases. On January 5, 2022, law enforcement officials were able to confiscate 756,000 methamphetamine pills, packed in 4 sacks (378 bundles), which was left on the Mekong River bank in Ban Phaeng district, Nakhon Phanom province. 34 Myanmar nationals were also arrested as they attempted to illegally enter the country at the border area in Fang district, Chiang Mai province.
The Prime Minister ordered for thorough investigation of the entire smuggling process, and strictly prosecute whoever found guilty in accordance with the law. Law enforcement officials and concerned agencies are also instructed to closely monitor migrant workers whose conduct and behavior may be inappropriate and considered a threat to public and property safety, or that they break the law or commit what is considered transnational crime.
