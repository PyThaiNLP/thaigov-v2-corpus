PM arrives in Tokyo for 27th Nikkei Forum
May 26, 2022, at 0630hrs (Japan local time), Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha and the delegation arrived at Haneda International Airport, Tokyo, Japan, to attend the 27th International Conference on the Future of Asia (Nikkei Forum) upon an invitation of Nikkei Inc. during May 26-27, 2022.
Aside from attending the 27th Nikkei Forum, the Prime Minister is scheduled to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. This will be their second meeting after the latter’s official visit to Thailand early this month, and will be a good opportunity for both parties to follow up on and take forward outcomes of the meeting in Thailand for an elevation of comprehensive strategic partnership. The Prime Minister will also meet with Japanese private sector to boost their confidence and affirm the Thai Government’s policy to support foreign direct investment and business operation, especially Japanese investment in new economic clusters. He will also underscore the Government’s implementation of the BCG Economic Model.
