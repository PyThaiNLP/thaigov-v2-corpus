Govt Spokesperson updates on COVID-19 measures to relief financial burden of business operators and people
August 15, 2021, Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri gave an update on the Government’s financial measures to assist business operators and the public.
According to the report of the Bank of Thailand released on August 9, 2021, soft loan facility for businesses (totaling 250 billion baht) to support viable small and medium enterprises (SMEs) affected by the COVID-19 crisis has so far been approved to 29,365 business operators for the total loan amount of 89,444 million Baht (approx. 3 million Baht/operator). The debt restructuring scheme through Asset Warehousing with Buy-Back options (totaling 100 billion baht) has assisted 50 business operators, with the total value of warehoused assets at 8,991 million Baht. These two schemes are aimed to support viable businesses, especially those in the tourism sector, so that they can remain open, maintain employment, and have opportunities to recover and transform themselves for the post-COVID-19 world.
As for the “Loan Against COVID-19” scheme administered by Government’s Savings Bank and the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC), which is available to employees, freelancers, small-scale farmers, and labors in the agricultural sector who are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic for the loan limit of 10,000 Baht/person without collateral, the Government’s Savings Bank reported that as of July 31, 2021, the total loan of 7 billion Baht has been released to 700,000 people, while BAAC reported the approval of loan, worth 111.87 million Baht, to 11,248 people as of August 9, 2021.
