Govt Spokesperson highlights linkup success between Thailand’s PromptPay and Singapore's PayNow real-time retail payment systems
Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed about success of the linkup between Thailand’s PromptPay and Singapore's PayNow real-time retail payment systems through the collaboration between the Bank of Thailand (BOT) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and stated that this is an example of the Government’s successful innovative development for regional connectivity. It is also Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha’s policy to promote international economic cooperation as part of Thailand’s effort to ‘build back better’.
Such collaboration is considered world’s first. Customers of participating banks in Thailand and Singapore will be able to make the transfer of up to S$1,000 or 25,000 baht per daybetween the two countries in just 1-2 minutes, instead of 1-2 days a normal mode of transfer would take, using just a mobile phone number via mobile application of participating banks.
According to the Government Spokesperson, Thailand’s success in the connectivity of payment system infrastructure between ASEAN countries would better facilitate SMEs andaccommodate international business growth.
