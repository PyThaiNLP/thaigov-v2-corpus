PM urges public to wait for court ruling on his 8-year tenure
August 23, 2022, Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister and Acting Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha emphasized about the issue of his 8-year tenure that he will listen to the court’s ruling, and affirmed that even the Prime Minister may not transgress into court jurisdiction. He called on the public to have faith in the law and the Rule of Law.
According to the Acting Government Spokesperson, with the current situation where the COVID-19 pandemic is still looming, public gathering to pressure for the Prime Minister’s resignation should be refrained as it may be considered a defying act against the Emergency Decree nationwide as a result of the COVID-19 situation.
