PM orders crackdown of goods hoarding while Govt rushes to curb pork price hike
January 21, 2021, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has closely followed up on pork price situation, and ordered concerned agencies to regularly report on the whole system of pork production and consumption. As of now, the Government has implemented a number of measures to address price hike problem, whether it be, 3-month ban of live pig export, a requirement for pig farmers/exporters/owners to prepare product inventory, which includes the detail on purchasing/sales volumes and prices, and product balances, ready for the authority to check at any time.
Following the Prime Minister’s order, the Department of Livestock has conducted inspection at cold-storage warehouses across the country, and cracked down hoarding of frozen pork at warehouses in Songkhla, Chanthaburi, and Pathum Thani provinces. According to the Government Spokesperson, anyone found to be hoarding goods will face a maximum imprisonment of one year or a fine not exceeding Bt20,000 or both.
The Prime Minister is especially concerned over the wellbeing of low-income earners who may be badly affected by the increase of necessities and consumer good prices. He called on all sides to take into account public interest, and not to take advantage of the price hike which may aggravate the situation and worsen people’s plight, while the Government is putting utmost effort to curb the problem.
