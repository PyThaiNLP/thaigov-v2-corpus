Top 3 registered businesses are: 1) goods transport and discharge (244 firms), 2) road freight (68 firms), and 3) transport agents (33 firms).

Thailand’s international trade value for January 2022 totaled 1.51 trillion Baht, an increase of 27.7%, out of which: 1) marine transport accounts for 66.5% (an increase of 30.4%) with oil, gas, petroleum, automotive and parts as key cargo types; 2) air transport accounts for 23% (an increase of 28.8%) with electronics circuit boards, phones, and machine parts as key cargo types; 3) land transport accounts for 10.4% (an increase of 10.8%) with computer memory units, diamonds, electronics circuit boards as key cargo types; and 4) rail transport accounts for 0.1% (an increase of 9.4%) with natural rubbers, synthetic rubbers, and plywood as key cargo types.
The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement, which has been pushed forward by the Prime Minister and has entered into force on January 1, 2022, is considered a major factor for Thailand’s export growth. RCEP member country markets have been opened for Thai logistics business. Likewise, Thailand has been opened for RCEP member countries to invest in transport services, making the country a part of the global value chains. In addition, the growth of e-commerce also contributes to the expansion of logistics business.
The Government Spokesperson added that the Government has placed importance on constant development of logistics system and skills in a bid to promote the country as regional hub for trade and investment, and services.
