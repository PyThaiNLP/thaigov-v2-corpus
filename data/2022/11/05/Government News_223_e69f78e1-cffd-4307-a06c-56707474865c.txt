PM orders security plan adjustment and tightening of security measures in Southern border provinces
January 30, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was reported on the bombing attack at 15 spots in Southern border Yala province on January 29, and made an immediate order for the Internal Security Operations Command Region 4 pine to rush with the investigation process. He also delegated Yala provincial governor to visit the injured at the hospitals, and residents and shop owners at the areas of bombing incidents on his behalf to give them moral support and help. The Internal Security Operations Command Region 4 pine believes the perpetrators just wanted to cause disturbance, following the authorities’ recent law enforcement in Narathiwat province.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister ordered local law enforcement officials to adjust plan, expand scope of surveillance, and tighten security measures in the economic and vulnerability areas, particularly during the Chinese New Year, to boost confidence on local people’s safety. Integrative operation must also be undertaken among local administrations, private sector, and local people on the intelligence front. The Prime Minister also denounced the bombing incident in Yala, which not only caused disturbance and damages to the lives and properties of others, but also ruined current economic and security momentum.
