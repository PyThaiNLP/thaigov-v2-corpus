PM thanks both cabinet members and MPs for duly performing duty at non-voting censure debate
February 19, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha thanked the cabinet members and all the MPs who joined the non-voting censure debate during the second annual ordinary session of the House of Representatives on February 17-18, 2022.
According to the Prime Minister, all sides, both the Legislative and the Executive, have performed respective duties to the best ability. He welcomed suggestions and recommendations made by the House MPs, especially those that would benefit the country and people, because their cooperation is important for the Government to address various issues of national concern. It is everyone’s duty to protect the democratic system with the King as head of state.
The Government Spokesperson added that the Government managed to clarify all the queries made by the Opposition. The Prime Minister also affirmed the Government’s commitment to address concurrent problems, while planning for the future. The Government Spokesperson, however, expressed concern on some of the distorted data cited by the Opposition which may affect national administration. He would, therefore, liaise with all concerned agencies to publicize correct information and data via various channels for public awareness.
