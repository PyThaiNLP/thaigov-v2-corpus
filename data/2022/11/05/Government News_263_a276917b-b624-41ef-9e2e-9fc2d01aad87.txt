PM pleased with implementation of Vaccinated Travel Lane between Thailand and Malaysia
March 8, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was pleased with the launch of Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) between Thailand and Malaysia from March 15, 2022 onward.
Concerned agencies of the two countries are now discussing in detail related procedure and protocol to waive quarantine for fully vaccinated Thai travelers. Air VTL would also be implemented between Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok (6 flights/day), and between Kuala Lumpur and Phuket (4 flights/day). Additional VTL flights will be subject to the joint agreement between the two countries.
According to the Government Spokesperson, Malaysia’s arrangement with Thailand would be along the line with the country’s air VTL arrangement with Singapore, under which fully vaccinated travelers are allowed to enter Malaysia without quarantine pending that they conduct an RT-PCR test no more than 2 days before departure and another test upon their arrival.
The Government Spokesperson added that the travel bubble agreement demonstrates tangible success of the bilateral meeting between the Prime Minister and Malaysian Prime Minister Dato' Sri Ismail Sabri bin Yaakob during the latter’s official visit to Thailand on February 25, 2022. The implementation of the Vaccinated Travel Lane is part of the two countries’ cooperation to reopen common border in a bid to promote border economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially trade and investment, and tourism.
