Cabinet approves COVID-19 vaccine procurement plan for 2022
September 28, 2021, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that the cabinet has made approval for Ministry of Public Health’s Department of Disease Control to proceed with the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca to be used in 2022, and approved the signing of contract between the Department of Disease Control and AstraZeneca, with the Department’s Director-General as signatory.
According to the Government Spokesperson, with the ongoing COVID-19 situation, it is the nation’s important agenda to tackle the disease spread. Acquisition of additional COVID-19 vaccines for 2022 is, therefore, necessary.
Under the plan, approx. 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines will be purchased and sent to Thailand by lots. The first lot (15 million doses) will be sent in the first quarter of 2022, the second (30 million doses) in the second quarter, and the last lot (15 million doses) in the third quarter of 2022.
