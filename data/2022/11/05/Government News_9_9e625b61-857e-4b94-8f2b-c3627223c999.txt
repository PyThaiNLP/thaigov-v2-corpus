PM satisfied with Thailand’s improvement in IMD competitiveness ranking
PM satisfied with Thailand’s improvement in IMD competitiveness ranking
June 19, 2021, Deputy Government Spokesperson Traisuree Taisaranakul disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was reported on the 2021 World Competitiveness Rankings, announced by IMD World Competitiveness Center, and expressed satisfaction over Thailand’s rank, which is up one rank to 28th, out of 64 economies, with the total score of 72.52. Although the total score decreased comparing to that of the previous year, the decrease is along the same line with other economies, which is as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The disease spread has greatly impacted all economic sectors, domestic investment, international trade, and tourism.
Under IMD’s world competitiveness index, Thailand’s economic performance factor has significantly reclined as tourism sector has been hit hard by the pandemic. The Prime Minister, therefore, reiterated the importance to regain momentum in tourism through the reopening of the country in 120 days, with the “Phuket Sandbox” as a model. The goal is to bring back normalcy to people’s livelihood.
In addition to economic rehabilitation at all levels and implementation of proactive disease control measures, the Government strives to enhance national competitiveness in the long run through promoting value-based economy, developing education and human resources, and minimizing economic and social disparity.
