MOPH offers "Nuad Thai" services for delegates of APEC health meeting, and raises Thai herbs for public health and economy
The Ministry of Public Health of Thailand has provided free "Nuad Thai" services for APEC health meeting attendees between 22-26 August 2022. There are 2 types of services provided, i.e., neck and shoulder massage (40 cases per day) and foot massages
The Ministry of Public Health of Thailand has provided free "Nuad Thai" services for APEC health meeting attendees between 22-26 August 2022. There are 2 types of services provided, i.e., neck and shoulder massage (40 cases per day) and foot massages (40 cases per day).  Nuad Thai was inscribed in UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2019.  Nuad Thai helps alleviate and cure office syndrome while "Thai herbs" are developed as health products.  These are very clear examples of how Thailand responds to the needs of public health and the economy.
Dr. Yongyot Thammavudhi, Director-General of the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine mentioned about the 12th High-Level Meeting on Health and Economy to be held between 22-26 August 2022 at the Millennium Hilton Bangkok that the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine was assigned to exhibit Thai traditional medicine, the use of medicinal herbs according to traditional knowledge and a demonstration of Nuad Thai.  Ten beds for Nuad Thai services will be set up for this event; 5 beds for neck and shoulder massage and 5 beds for foot massage. Each service can accommodate 40 cases per day. The space for each massage case will be arranged separately with a partition between the beds and COVID-19 free standard.  Both service provider and service recipient must wear masks all the time; cleaning before and after receiving services is always done.
Dr. Yongyot said the Department would present Thai traditional medicine service and herbs for health care because it is beneficial for health care as well as creating higher economic value.  It is one of the clear examples of continually promoting health and economic development in Thailand. For example, Nuad Thai has been listed in UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity on December 12, 2019.  It is a unique identity of Thailand that foreigners are interested in and fond of receiving Nuad Thai services, especially in health tourism.  There are both Nuad Thai for health promotion and Nuad Thai for disease therapy such as muscle pain or office syndrome.  According to Thai traditional medical knowledge, such syndrome is called Lom Plai Pattakhat disease which is a type of epilepsy that causes poor circulation, blood clots, and hardening in the muscles, tendons, and ribs causing pain, hard as a lump along the muscle bundle. Such symptoms can be relieved by Nuad Thai.
"Contraindications for Nuad Thai are as follows: 1. Fever over 38.5 degrees Celsius 2. Khai Pit, Khai Kan (fever according to Thai traditional medicine) such as chickenpox, shingles 3. Infectious skin diseases 4. Communicable diseases such as tuberculosis 5. Appendicitis 6. Broken bones, fractures that are not completely attached 7. A blood disorder such as a blood clotting disorder 8. Inflammation, infection, swelling, redness, heat, and 9. after having an accident.  Precautions for Nuad Thai include pregnant women, prosthetic implants after orthopedic surgery, people with underlying diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and with loose joints, osteoporosis, and those who just have a meal prior massage within 30 minutes before the massage. The study found that neck and shoulder massage helped relieve muscle stiffness which showed no difference between the group taking pain medications and muscle relaxants and the group taking medicine together with Nuad Thai" said Dr. Yongyot.
Dr. Yongyot added that herbs could build health and economy by developing herbs into various herbal products. Since 2017, the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine has promoted 12 herbs as Champion Products, namely black galingale (Kaempferia parviflora), turmeric (Curcuma longa L.), Gotu kola (Centella asiatica) and phlai (Zingiber cassumunar). Kwao Krua Khao (Pueraria candollei Graham ex Benth. var mirifica (Airy Shaw et Suvat.)), Indian gooseberry (Phyllanthus emblica L.), white galingale (Boesenbergia rotunda (Linn.) Mansf.), chilli (Capsicum frutescens Linn.), king of bitter (Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wall.ex Nees.), roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.), stevia (Stevia Rebaudiana Bertoni) and aloe vera (Aloe vera (L.) Burm.f.). Currently, Thailand is pushing a policy on medical cannabis for health care and economy.  We aim to make Thailand a leader of the region in herbal products that meet the standards and the world’s herbal innovation center subsequently. It is expected that in 2022, herbal products and Thai traditional medicine, and alternative medicine will generate an income of approximately 78,000 million baht. Hence, in order to create a good image for Thai Herbs, the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine has prepared special souvenirs made from Thai herbs such as essential oils, fragrances, and cosmetic products for Ministers of Health and spouses, speakers, and delegates of APEC economies of this upcoming meeting.
