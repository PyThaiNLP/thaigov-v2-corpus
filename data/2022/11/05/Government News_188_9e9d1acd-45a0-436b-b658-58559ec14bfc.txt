PM orders full-fledged implementation of “Transforming Thailand” toward high-value and sustainable tourism
Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha ordered all concerned agencies to undertake a full-fledged implementation of “Transforming Thailand” policy toward high-value and sustainable tourism under the 3R plan: 1) reopening (3rd quarter of 2021), 2) recovering (4th quarter of 2022), and 3) resilience (2023-2027).
Ministry of Tourism and Sports has planned to open the border provinces to accept foreign tourists, especially from Malaysia, Myanmar, Lao PDR, and Cambodia. Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) expects an approximate number of 8-15 million foreign tourists, and the revenue of 1.3-1.8 trillion Baht in 2022. Opening the borders to allow entering by land would help the country to reach such targets.
The Prime Minister emphasized that economic rehabilitation and public healthcare policy be undertaken simultaneously through control measures that are conducive to conducting economic activities. The confidence of tourists must be boosted as a basis for “high-value and sustainable tourism” promotion. Everyone is urged to take part in “Transforming Thailand” by attracting high quality tourists with spending power and socio-environmental responsibility to Thailand.
