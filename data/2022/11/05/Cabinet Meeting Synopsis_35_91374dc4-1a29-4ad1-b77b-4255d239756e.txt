Title: Report on the Industrial Economics Status in December 2021
The cabinet acknowledged Industrial Economic Report for December 2021 as proposed by Ministry of Industry.

Based on the report, manufacturing production index (MPI) expanded by 6.8% YOY thanks to increasing domestic and overseas demands in various products, following the ease of lockdown.
Key industries that contributed to the expansion of MPI in December 2021 are automotive (+9.15%), petroleum refinery (+7.54%), sugar (+31.52%), electronics parts (+14.24%), and non-tyre rubber products (+16.08%).
Title: Extension of stay in Thailand for migrant workers of Cambodian Laos and Myanmar nationalities under MOU
The cabinet approved the following proposals made by Ministry of Labor:
Approved management of migrant workers of Cambodian Laos and Myanmar nationalities entering Thailand on Labor Cooperation MOU under the 2019 Agreement, whose 4-year employment term will end in 2022.
Approved in principle the draft Interior Ministerial on exemption of prohibition against aliens’ entry into the Kingdom as a special case for migrant workers of Cambodian Laos and Myanmar nationalities on a memorandum of understanding (MoU) under the 2019 Agreement.
Gist
This is to allow migrant workers from Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar who entered Thailand on a memorandum of understanding (MoU) under the 2019 Agreement to extend their stay in the country for another 6 months to sort out their employment status and work permits, which may be extended up to 2 years.
These migrant workers, whose 4-year employment term will end this year (January 1 and December 31, 2022) will be able to apply for work permit or extension of work permit or temporary stay for not more than 2 years without having to leave the country. The extension is approved to solve the problem of workers’ reentry into the country, control the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, and to help businesses that rely on migrant workers to be able to operate, thereby, propelling and revitalizing national economic system.
At present, there are 106,580 on a memorandum of understanding (MoU) under the 2019 Agreement (26,840 from Cambodia, 25,504 from Lao PDR, and 54,236 from Myanmar).
Title: Thailand’s membership in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
The cabinet approved Thailand’s membership in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and authorized Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam, who oversees the administration of Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO), to sign the letter of intent to apply for Thailand’s membership in FATF. This is as proposed by AMLO.
Gist
The Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering) (FATF) is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering. In 2001, its mandate was expanded to include terrorism financing. Thailand has been a member of Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG), which is an associate member of the FATF.
Thailand’s membership in the FATF would enhance its AML/CFT role at the international stage, and promote positive image of the country’s financial system and international trade and investment.
