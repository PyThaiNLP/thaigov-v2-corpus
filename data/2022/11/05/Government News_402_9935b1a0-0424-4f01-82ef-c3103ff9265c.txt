Cabinet approves Joint Statement of the Fourth ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Women to promote gender equality and empowerment in ASEAN
July 18, 2022, Deputy Government Spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek disclosed that the cabinet, in its meeting today, approved the draft Joint Statement of the Fourth ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Women, held on October 11-15, 2021 in Jakarta, Republic of Indonesia, as proposed by Ministry of Social Development and Human Security.
The draft Joint Statement of the Fourth ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Women is aimed to reaffirm commitment of all member states to promote gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls in the ASEAN region pursuant to the ASEAN Community Vision 2025.
Gist of the draft Joint Statement is as follows:
Expresses awareness on the long-term and gendered impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic among women and girls
Recognizes that women tend to fare worse than men for many SDG-related outcomes, and that groups of women living in rural areas, in poor households, ethnic women, women with disabilities, and migrant women, face the most risk of being left behind in relation to SDG progress
Underscores opportunities afforded by the digital revolution such as access to the digital economy, promoting women’s digital entrepreneurship, and strengthening digital literacy and competitiveness are equipping the women of ASEAN to adapt and thrive in the post-pandemic ASEAN region
Accelerates efforts that include women in the digital economy through providing or improving accessibility, affordability of financial products and services, conducting capacity building or trainings, enhancing market opportunities and linkages, and other policy, program and infrastructure support
Strengthens consultative platforms and mechanism that directly engage women in decision- and policy-making processes, and amplify their voices and consider their needs, to ensure that the design and implementation of policies and programs are gender-responsive
Ministry of Social Development and Human Security will later notify the ASEAN Secretariat on the cabinet’s approval of the draft Joint Statement of the Fourth ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Women.
