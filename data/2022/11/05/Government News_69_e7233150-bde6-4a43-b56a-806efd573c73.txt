Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has conveyed his moral support to the Thai athletes who will be attending the 16th Summer Paralympic Games, hosted by Japan during August 24- September 5, 2021.
The “Tokyo 2020 Paralympics” will be attended by over 4,520 athletes from 164 National Paralympics committees to compete in 22 sports (540 events). Two sports will be debuted at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics, namely, taekwondo, and badminton. 74 Thai athletes have been qualified to compete in 14 sports: taekwondo, badminton, archery, wheelchair fencing, powerlifting, swimming, table tennis, athletics, cycling, shooting, wheelchair tennis, boccia, football 5-a-side, and judo.
The Prime Minister sent his moral support to the athletes and staffs of all sports teams, and thanked them for their commitment, perseverance, and discipline in practicing their respective sports under the challenging situation. He also wishes everyone success, and emphasized the importance for the Thai athletes to strictly comply with public health measures of the host country for their safety, which will also be a good model to athletes of other countries.
According to the Government Spokesperson, like the previously-held Tokyo 2020 Olympics, spectators will not be allowed to attend the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics, but to watch all the events via live broadcast due to the COVID-19 situation.
