Govt Spokesperson: COVID-19 patients remain entitled to free treatment
January 4, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana clarified about an information spread throughout the social media that the cabinet decided not to subsidize treatment of COVID-19 patients who are unvaccinated, whereas for the vaccinated patients who are also social security/gold card holders must be treated at the hospital they registered in order to receive the treatment free of charge. Those who want to stay at a hospitel or be treated at a private hospital will have to shoulder their own treatment expenses. Hospitalization criteria for mild-symptom patients have also been adjusted to encourage home/community isolation.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the statement above is simply a proposal of concerned agency, deliberated at the cabinet meeting on December 28, 2022, on which the cabinet assigned Ministry of Public Health’s Department of Health Service Support to work together with the National Health Security Office and other concerned agencies to further consider implementation propriety and timeframe for the normalization of the Universal Coverage for Emergency Patients Scheme in line with the COVID-19 situation and public best interest before further decision is to be made. Therefore, as of now all related measures remain unchanged.
The Government Spokesperson reaffirmed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has made public healthcare the Government’s priority. COVID-19 patients of all cases are entitled to free treatment which will be subsidized by the Government.
