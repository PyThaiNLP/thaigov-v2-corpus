Govt commits to carry out post-COVID 19 promotion for sustainable employment of people with disabilities
Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that the Government has placed equal importance to the people of all groups under the policy of Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha, especially the opportunities given to people in the vulnerability groups to enhance their quality of life. One clear example is that the Asia-Pacific Development Center on Disability (APCD) was allowed to film a project on “Disability Inclusive Business (DIB)” at APCD 60+ Plus Bakery and Chocolate Café, Government House branch, during December 20-22, 2021 to promote employment opportunity for people with disabilities and those from the vulnerability groups through onsite trainings and working.
The Prime Minister chaired the opening of the Café on August 7, 2021 to demonstrate the Government’s support and commitment to take care of people of all groups, especially the people in the vulnerability groups, as well as to publicize promotion of sustainable employment opportunity of the people with disabilities.
According to the Government Spokesperson, APCD is a regional center for those with disabilities and development. APCD was established in Bangkok, Thailand as a legacy of the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons, 1993-2002, with joint collaboration of the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, the Thai Government and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Government of Japan. APCD was endorsed by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) as a regional cooperative base for its Biwako Millennium Framework for an inclusive society in the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons, 2003-2012.
