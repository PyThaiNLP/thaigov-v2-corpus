PM sends moral support to Thai athletes competing in “Tokyo 2020 Olympics”
July 22, 2021, Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has conveyed his moral support to the Thai athletes who will be attending the 32nd Olympic Games and the 16th Summer Paralympic Games, hosted by Japan during July 23- August 8, 2021, and August 24- September 5, 2021 respectively. Over 11,000 athletes from 206 countries will participate in 33 sports at the “Tokyo 2020 Olympics”.  There are 41 Thai athletes who qualified to join the 32nd olympic games.
The Prime Minister sent his moral support to the athletes and staffs of all sports teams, and thanked them for their commitment, perseverance, and discipline in practicing their respective sports under the challenging situation. He wishes everyone success. However, with or without the medals, they will surely become role models for the nation's youths and new generation of athletes. He also emphasized the importance for the Thai athletes to strictly comply with public health measures of the host country for their safety, which will also be a good model to athletes of other countries.
Six sports will be either debuted or reintroduced at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, namely, baseball (men)/ softball (women), karate, skateboarding, sport climbing and surfing, while 2 additional sports will make their Olympic debuts at the 16th Summer Paralympic Games: badminton and taekwondo. For the first time in history, spectators will not be allowed to attend the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, but to watch all the events via live broadcast due to the COVID-19 situation.
