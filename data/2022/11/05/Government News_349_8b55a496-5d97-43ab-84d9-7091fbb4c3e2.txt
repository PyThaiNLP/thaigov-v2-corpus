Govt Spokesperson: CCSA to conduct thorough assessment before making decision on easing mask-wearing measure
June 7, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed about relaxation of mask-wearing measure in Bangkok that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha, in his capacity as chair of the Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA), has earlier handed down the policy to CCSA, pending the continuously improving COVID-19 situation, in order for people’s lives and economic situation to return to normalcy.
According to the Government Spokesperson, relaxation of COVID-19 measures could not be implemented arbitrarily. CCSA has to make thorough assessment and consideration, taking into account COVID-19 situation in each area, and people’s health and safety. At the time being, everyone is urged to continue wearing hygienic mask and observe all other healthcare etiquettes, such as washing hands and keeping social distance. They are also advised to follow up on COVID-19 measure relaxation updates from CCSA to ensure that they receive accurate and up-to-date information.
