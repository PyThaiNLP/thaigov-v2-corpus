"The Prime Minister thanks Thai women's national volleyball team, staffs, coaches, and everyone involved in making Thai brothers and sisters happy throughout the VNL 2022 volleyball tournament." This team has set a new record for the Thai volleyball industry by reaching the final eight teams for the first time and finishing in eighth place. "The Prime Minister and all Thais are very proud, and I'd like to encourage Thai women's volleyball in future competitions," Thanakorn said.
