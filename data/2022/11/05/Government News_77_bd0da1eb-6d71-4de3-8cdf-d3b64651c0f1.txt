August 29, 2021, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana thanked various Government agencies for conducting public surveys on the issues and situations that are currently in the public interest and on the Government’s performances. The Government is open to comments and would take those comments into consideration for the improvement of national administration, policies, and measures, to be most relevant with the people’s need.
As for the result of the recent surveys which show the public’s need for the Government’s effective management and administration on COVID-19 situation and economic rehabilitation, the Government Spokesperson insisted that the Government, as well as all public agencies, have been putting utmost effort to tackle the spread of COVID-19 to ensure sufficient medical facilities and supplies, as well as vaccines, in parallel with implementation of relief measures to remedy the COVID-19 impact against the public and some specific groups, e.g., entrepreneurs, SMEs, farmers, workers, freelancers, and students.
With the cooperation of the public to strictly comply with the Government’s COVID-19 measures, the number of infected patients has continually decreased throughout the past 2 weeks, while the number of recoveries has been increasing. The Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration has also made approval to allow some businesses/activities to reopen under the New Normal and the COVID-19 control measures, with the intention to move forward national economy. Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha also instructed public agencies to expedite their works and missions, implemented according to the Government’s key policies and strategies, and regularly give an update to the public in a bid to boost their confidence and to prove the Government’s result-based management and administration.
