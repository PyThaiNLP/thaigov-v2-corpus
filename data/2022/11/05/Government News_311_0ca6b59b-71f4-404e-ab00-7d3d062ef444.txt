Japanese PM to make official visit to Thailand during May 1-2
April 28, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that H.E. Mr. KISHIDA Fumio, Prime Minister of Japan, is scheduled to make an official visit to Thailand during May 1-2, 2022.
This visit will be the first official visit to Thailand of Prime Minister Kishida, and the first official visit of a Japanese Prime Minister in 9 years, following the latest visit of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2013. This visit of Prime Minister Kishida is considered a special one, as this year marks the 135th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries. In addition, Thailand is now the ASEAN-Japan Coordinator (2021-2023), and would also like to demonstrate its preparedness for the hosting of APEC, to be held at the end of this year.
During the visit, the Japanese Prime Minister is scheduled to have a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha to discuss reinforcement of relations and cooperation between the two countries in both health, economic and security dimensions, as well as sub-regional and regional development, and post-COVID-19 recoveries. Both leaders will also exchange views on the ongoing international situation, and witness the signing of MOU and agreements between the two countries.
