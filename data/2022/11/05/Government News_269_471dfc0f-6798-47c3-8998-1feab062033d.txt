PM pleased with Fitch Ratings (Thailand)’s projection on continuous recovery of Thai corporate earnings in 2022
March 14, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was reported on the outcome of a seminar on “2022 Thailand Corporate Credit Outlook” which disclosed the projection of Fitch Ratings (Thailand) that the earnings of rated corporates in Thailand will continue to recover in 2022.
This is supported by a recovery in economic activity and a gradual reopening of the country from the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit ratings are expected to be mostly steady, although some sectors are likely to remain affected by weak demand stemming from the pandemic. Rated Thai corporate issuers have demonstrated prudent cash flow management during the pandemic, with cautious capital expenditure and lower dividend payouts.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Government strives to promote stable economic recovery through urgent stimulus measures, while nurturing the vulnerability groups, and seeking new business opportunities for the interest of the nation and people. The Fitch Ratings (Thailand)’s report reflects confidence on the Thai business sector and the Prime Minister’s vision and economic policies.
The Government has been putting utmost effort to stabilize economic rehabilitation through such endeavors as the development of Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), infrastructure development in various areas to enhance national competitiveness, implementation of the BCG Economic Model for sustainable growth, and promotion of economic activities in parallel with enforcing health care measures to ensure effective, inclusive, and complete problem solution.
