Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana conveyed the condolences of Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha on the passing of former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe, who had greatly contributed to the development of bilateral relations between Thailand and Japan.
According to the Prime Minister, the late Prime Minister Abe was a very capable person, and very much loved especially by the Japanese people. During the 8 years of his premiership, the late Prime Minister Abe had taken on an important role in promoting relations and friendship between Thailand and Japan. His visit to Thailand in 2013 was the first official visit of a Japanese leader in 11 years, and has laid strong foundation for bilateral relations and cooperation between both countries. He had also been a strong supporter for ASEAN-Japan relations during the past several years.
On behalf of the Thai Government and people, the Prime Minister expressed profound condolences to the family of the late Prime Minister Abe, and the Japanese Government and people for such a loss.
