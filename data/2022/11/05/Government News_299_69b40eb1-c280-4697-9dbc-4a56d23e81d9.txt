​PM advises public and private sector to take ATK test of holiday-returning staffs
April 17, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha expressed concern over the first work day after the long period of Songkran Holiday, and called on all sectors, be it, public and private sectors, state enterprises, businesses, and shops, to take the ATK test of their employees and staffs prior to their return to the office, and closely monitor their health.
The Department of Disease Control has issued a warning for those who have returned from holiday to monitor their health for 7-10 days, avoid meeting with others, always wear mask, and work from home, if possible. Should certain symptoms, such as fever, running nose, or coughing, develop, they must immediately seek medical advice, and undergo the test.
According to the Government Spokesperson, the Prime Minister believes that enough rest and moral support boosted from returning home to important ones would enhance everyone’s energy and work effectiveness. However, the COVID-19 situation prevails, and they are urged to strictly observe universal prevention measures and take good care of themselves to alleviate the burden of medical personnel who have been working very hard now.
