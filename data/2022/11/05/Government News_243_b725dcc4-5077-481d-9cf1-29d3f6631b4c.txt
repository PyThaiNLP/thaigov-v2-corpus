February 17, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha expressed concern over the wellbeing of medical workers, following a report on the COVID-19 infection of 156 medical workers on February 16, which is the highest number for a day since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. He urged the doctors and medical staffs to take good care of themselves, especially when on duty, as they are very crucial to the country’s public healthcare system. The people are also called on to rush in receiving the 3rd and 4th shots of vaccine to ensure that they are well-immune against serious symptoms and fatality.
With an increasing number of newly-infected cases, the Prime Minister instructed Ministry of Public Health and concerned agencies to closely monitor both domestic and global COVID-19 situation, especially in communities and schools. Covid Free Setting and Universal Prevention measures must be strictly complied with, and vaccination must be expedited to cover people of all groups, including students of all ages, and ensure herd immunity. Thailand is also aware of and has closely followed up on the first ‘Deltacron’ cases in the United Kingdom, which is the COVID strain that combines Delta and Omicron. The Prime Minister remains confident that Thai public healthcare system and measures are strong and effective enough to also handle the new COVID-19 variant.
