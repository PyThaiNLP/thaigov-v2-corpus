December 26, 2021, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was reported on EU’s endorsement of Thailand Digital Health Pass on “Mor Prom” application for the entering into 60 countries/territories, recognized by EU, and commended concerned agencies for making this happened. The endorsement reflects the Thai Government’s effective and timely implementation of related policy. The Thailand Digital Health Pass system is also relevant with the systems used by other countries.
Thailand is the 2nd country in ASEAN that has been endorsed by EU. The Thailand Digital Health Pass is equivalent to the EU’s COVID-19 clearance certificate and can be used from January 2022 onward. Information shown in the Pass includes vaccination history, results of the COVID-19 tests (both RT-CPR and ATK), and history on COVID-19 recovery.
With the Thailand Digital Health Pass on Mor Prom application, the Thai citizens will be able to enter into and visit places in EU countries/territories. Nevertheless, the Thai people are still required to strictly follow public health measures in the countries/territories they are going to.
