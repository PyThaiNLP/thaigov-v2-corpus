June 11, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha commended the cooperation of Thailand and Germany on electric vehicle promotion in Thailand through organization of the “EV Hackathon: Future EV Mobility Creative Contest for Sustainability #EV4Sustain”, which is aimed to promote exchanges of creative ideas and knowledge of electric vehicles amongst the future generation. The event also built upon the Government’s policy on EVs promotion and the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) economic model.
According to the Government Spokesperson, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in collaboration with King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok (KMUTNB), and the Embassy of Germany in Thailand, are organizing “Future EV Mobility Creative Contest for Sustainability” or the “EV Hackathon for Sustainability #EV4Sustain” from June to August 2022 to commemorate the 160th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Thailand and Germany.
Not only is the competition in line with the theme of the 160th anniversary between Thailand and Germany – “Partners for Sustainable Growth,” Thailand can also benefit from Germany’s expertise in the electric vehicle industry in transforming Thailand into a low-carbon society under the 30/30 policy with 30% of total production to be ZEV (Zero Emission Vehicle) by 2030. The “EV Hackathon for Sustainability” also resonates with Thailand’s Bio-Circular-Green Economy policy and Germany’s Energy Transition and Climate Change policy. The Prime Minister took the occasion to thank Germany for continuing to take part in Thailand’s economic and environmental promotion endeavor.
