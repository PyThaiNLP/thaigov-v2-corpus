May 10, 2022, Government Spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana disclosed that Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen.

Besides, infection is now in plateau in 23 provinces, and declining in 54 provinces. Nevertheless, everyone is strongly advised to comply with “2U”, which is the Universal Prevention and Universal Vaccination, in order for the country to transition to the endemic phase.
