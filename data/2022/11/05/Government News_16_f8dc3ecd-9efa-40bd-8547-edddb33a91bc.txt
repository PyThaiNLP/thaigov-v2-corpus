Thailand ranks 1st among ASEAN countries on UN Sustainable Development Report 2021
Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri disclosed that Cambridge University Press has published Sustainable Development Report 2021, according to which Thailand ranks 43rd among 165 countries across the world, 3rd in the Asian continent, and 1st among ASEAN member countries.
The Sustainable Development Report 2021 presents progress of each country on achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Thailand’s overall score is 74.19, which is higher than the regional average of 65.7. According to the report, the country has achieved considerable success in eradicating extreme poverty as part of SDG1, while SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) are on track toward SDG achievement. However, major challenges remain for SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality), SDG 14 (Life under Water), and SDG 15 (Life on Land).
It was also reported that the annual report shows a reversal in progress for the first time since Heads of State of all 193 UN member countries agreed on these universal goals at a historic summit in 2015, as COVID-19 pandemic has created not only a global health emergency but also a sustainable development crisis.
