PM concerned over online gambling during UEFA EURO 2020
June 15, 2021, at 1240hrs, at Thai Khu Fah Building, Government House, following the weekly cabinet meeting, Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha affirmed the Government’s commitment to solve all COVID-19-related problems to alleviate people’s bread and butter concern, and plan for the country’s future under the New Normal. All projects and plans must be undertaken in a transparent and accountable manner.
With regard to the Government’s anti-narcotics effort, as a national agenda, concerned agencies have been ordered to explore communities and villages across the country in a bid to officially register drug addicts for proper treatment. Drug dealers will also be strictly prosecuted according to laws. The Prime Minister also expressed concern over recent online gambling during the Euro 2020 football tournament as he does not want the people to pile up their debts.
He also praised and gave moral support to the Thai volleyball players who are now participating in the 2021 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League as those veteran players have exercised their spirits and sacrifice in accepting the callup of Thailand Volleyball Association, to the happiness of the Thai people, to replace players and officials who tested positive for COVID-19 right before the tournament began.
