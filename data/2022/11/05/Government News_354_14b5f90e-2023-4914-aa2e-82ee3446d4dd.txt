Prayut Chan-o-cha commended concerned agencies for successful signing of Statement of Commitment to Sustainable Thailand, by Ministry of Interior and the provincial governors of Thailand, together with the United Nations on June 6, 2022.

According to the Government Spokesperson, upon signing the Statement of Commitment to Sustainable Thailand, 76 Provincial Governors of Thailand commit to building capacity and awareness on sustainable development within their respective provinces in collaboration with the United Nations Country Team and its partners. In addition, localization, through engaging and mobilizing local authorities and municipalities in the endeavor of sustainable development capacity and awareness building, is what the Prime Minister has prioritized all along.
