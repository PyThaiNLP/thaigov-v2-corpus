A number of measures has been eased to facilitate incoming tourists, such as reduction of quarantine period to 7 days, measures related to Group COE, permission of Russia’s commercial flights to Phuket, etc. The plan to transform Phuket to a ‘World Class Destination’ in 2022 will be carried out under the concept of SUPRA, that is, 1) Safety, 2) Upgrading, 3) Pro-Poor, 4) Refine, and 5) Activities.
According to the Government Spokesperson, 62 out of 72 million Thais will be vaccinated by the end of this year, accounting for 90% of the country’s populations. By then, Thailand will be ready to transform its tourism to become world class destination with recognized public health standard that could boost confidence of both foreign tourists and Thai people.
